msgctxt "0041 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Thinking fast, Kokichi closed the shutter\n"

msgid ""
"When Maki returned with the antidote, she\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...so she went around to the hangar bathroom\n"

msgctxt "0045 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0047 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Maki must have been panicking, thinking\n"

msgctxt "0048 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"She believed that the culprit was going to\n"
"die from her own poisoned arrow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But it was all another one of <CLT=cltSTRONG>Kokichi's lies<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But she couldn't get the shutter to open again.\n"

msgctxt "0052 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"After Maki had left, Kokichi took out another\n"

msgctxt "0053 | C000_Saiha"

"An <CLT=cltSTRONG>Electrobomb<CLT=cltNORMAL> capable of disabling\n"

msgctxt "0054 | C000_Saiha"

"Kokichi's plan was to use an Electrobomb to\n"

msgctxt "0055 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0057 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"In exchange for the antidote, Kokichi asked\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Kokichi needed to work with the culprit\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Under normal circumstances, the culprit\n"
"would never have agreed to such a plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But because the culprit owed him for saving\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah, \"request\" is a generous term.\n"
"It was more like blackmail."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"In any case, the two were now working\n"

msgctxt "0063 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"There was a lot to prepare, and not a lot\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"They had to work fast. If Kokichi died from the\n"
"Strike-9 Poison, the whole plan would be ruined."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"After fabricating the scene in the bathroom, the\n"
"culprit dragged Kokichi to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>hydraulic press<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"This is how the <CLT=cltSTRONG>swipe pattern bloodstain<CLT=cltNORMAL> from\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Kokichi, with the support of the culprit, stood\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The two of them were finally ready\n"

msgctxt "0069 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"While Kokichi was setting up the <CLT=cltSTRONG>video camera<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"near the hydraulic press's control panel..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"the culprit laid <CLT=cltSTRONG>face up<CLT=cltNORMAL> inside the press,\n"
"draping their coat <CLT=cltSTRONG>over their shoulders<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Then, Kokichi activated the <CLT=cltSTRONG>press<CLT=cltNORMAL> and the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The press got lower and lower, and just as\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Kokichi pressed the \"<CLT=cltSTRONG>Force Stop<CLT=cltNORMAL>\" button and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The two then switched places...and also\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "The \"culprit\"...and the \"victim.\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The would-be victim became our culprit and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Kokichi had saved the culprit's life because\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"He wanted to win the killing game...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And so, Kokichi was crushed by the press,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>culprit's left sleeve<CLT=cltNORMAL> was dangling from\n"
"the press, making us think he was the victim."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Now alone, the culprit collected the video\n"
"camera..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...and tore the hydraulic press's power cord,\n"
"so that it could never be raised again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"This would make it impossible for us to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But there was another reason the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C000_Saiha"
