"That's it...the <CLT=cltSTRONG>Exisal<CLT=cltNORMAL>! The Exisal could be\n"
"used to enter the hangar!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"We couldn't get in because of the alarm\n"
"system and the electric barrier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...but that shouldn't have been a problem\n"
"for any of the Exisals, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"So if you wanted to enter the hangar, all\n"
"you had to do was pilot an Exisal!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "I saw an Exisal enter the hangar last night..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "So was this third party piloting it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"By the way, I just wanna confirm something\n"
"with Monokuma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Would the alarm still go off if there was a\n"
"person inside an Exisal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Well, I wasn't trying to keep this secret, but\n"
"since it's about the details of the hangar..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C020_Monok"
msgid "...I guess I can tell you guys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"It makes sense that the alarm system and\n"
"electric barrier wouldn't react to an Exisal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"After all, the hangar is where the Exisals\n"
"are supposed to be stored."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"It'd be a hassle to disable the security every\n"
"time an Exisal comes and goes, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"So even if someone is inside an Exisal, the\n"
"security system wouldn't catch 'em."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Cuz it'd be a hassle to leave the Exisal\n"
"every time you have to put it away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"So it's like Shuichi said? A third party\n"
"got in an Exisal and entered the hangar?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "But...can just anyone pilot an Exisal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "...Well, Kokichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"It's surprisingly easy. If you use both hands,\n"
"both feet, and both nipples, you can do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Nipples, too!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Anyway, this third party commandeered\n"
"an Exisal and infiltrated the hangar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That same person must have brought\n"
"the other two arrows with them!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "I told you, that's impossible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"There's no way you can get through security\n"
"if you pilot an Exisal. It's...not possible..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "What? Not possible...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C010_Haruk"

msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>What are you thinking?\n"
"What do you know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C000_Saiha"
