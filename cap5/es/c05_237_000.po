msgctxt "0010 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0037 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0038 | C000_Saiha"

"To operate the press and the camera at the\n"

"There was a reason the camera was set up\n"

msgctxt "0045 | C000_Saiha"

"When the press was stopped, you couldn't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That was intentional. The body is mostly\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"The camera must've been placed at such a\n"

msgctxt "0051 | C010_Haruk"

msgctxt "0052 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Kokichi used that video angle trick, and\n"

msgctxt "0053 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "In that case, Kaito is—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Before he was crushed by the press,\n"
"he was swapped with a different body!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C009_Yumen"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C000_Saiha"

msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C007_Ki-Bo"

"Well, Monokuma? Do the rules allow for\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C020_Monok"
msgid "Very well, I'll answer that."

msgctxt "0067 | C041_ExOma"
