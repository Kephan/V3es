msgctxt "0010 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0011 | C012_Shiro"

msgctxt "0013 | C010_Haruk"

msgctxt "0014 | C000_Saiha"

"The bathroom... I see... That certainly is \n"
"the best place to lock someone up."

msgctxt "0016 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "And I also saw..."

msgid ""
"Monokuma by the hangar, being\n"
"protected by four Exisals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"So we have to be careful that\n"
"we aren't spotted."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Oh, I saw that too."

msgctxt "0020 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"What? You saw that...?\n"
"Were you at the hangar, too, Keebo?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Yes...I thought maybe I could get through to\n"
"Kokichi before we carry out our plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"So I went to the hangar last night and tried\n"
"to talk to him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "You tried to...talk to him on your own?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"I'm sorry... I thought it would be preferable\n"
"for him to release Kaito peacefully..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "How did it go?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"It went about as well as I expected...\n"
"There was no response at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "But I did witness a few things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Wh-What? What...did you witness?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"We can discuss that later. For now, I'll share\n"

msgctxt "0030 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Shuichi saw four Exisals that appeared to\n"
"be guarding Monokuma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Well, I saw one of them enter the hangar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Just one?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Yes, the green Exisal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The green one...\n"
"I'm sure I saw that one guarding Monokuma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"I made sure to stay out of sight while I\n"
"watched."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Neither the alarm system nor the electric\n"
"barrier reacted to the Exisal's presence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Does that mean the alarm system and the \n"
"electric barrier don't work on the Exisals?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Considering it's where the Exisals are stored,\n"
"that would appear to be a safe assumption."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Anyway, there are two Exisals in the hangar.\n"
"We should be careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "We only have one chance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Since this is our only Electrobomb, we can't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "That's exactly right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Well then! We're off for real this time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Let's go! We must end this killing game\n"
"once and for all, no matter what!"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Energized and motivated, the group rushed out\n"
