"Even without going in the hangar, it was\n"
"possible to land a shot with the crossbow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"There was a <CLT=cltSTRONG>window<CLT=cltNORMAL> in the bathroom\n"
"of the hangar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Maybe it wasn't possible to get in, but\n"
"you could have shot through the window."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And remember that Kaito was confined\n"
"to the bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"So if they shot Kaito through the window,\n"
"they could've killed him in the hangar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Which means, the murder suspect list\n"
"grows to six people, including me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Nyeh!? What did you say!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "But...put plainly, that means..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"It seems Shuichi wants to make one of us\n"
"the culprit. Is that it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...Is that what a detective does?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Do detectives always accuse people, even\n"
"when they're friends?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"...It seems like it. You suspected Kaito in \n"
"the previous class trial, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "You're always suspicious of your friends."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "..."

msgctxt "0016 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Wh-What's wrong, Maki?\n"
"You seem like you're kind of on edge..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "Of course I am."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"When we said we would defeat the Remnants\n"
"of Despair, *someone* got in our way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"No, you don't understand,\n"
"I'm not trying to—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"It doesn't matter how much you get in my\n"
"way, I will absolutely defeat Kokichi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"I won't let despair escape...\n"
"I won't let it win..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Now, now! Let's stop this boring fight and \n"
"continue on with the not-so-boring trial!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"So we all agree that the murder could be\n"
"done by anyone and not just me, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Th-That might be true, but...\n"
"I...didn't know about the window..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Neither did I..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Really, Himiko. What's the matter? You've \n"
"been weird since we mentioned small holes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Wh-What!? Are you after my small hole, too!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "See? Now that's definitely weird."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Look at it this way—just because the culprit\n"
"could be anyone, not everyone is a suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"We can pretty much narrow it down to\n"
"anyone who knew about the crossbow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "I never knew about any crossbows!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"I-In other words, I'm not suspicious!\n"
"Th-There's no way you can consider me—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"It does concern me that Himiko went\n"
"to the hangar last night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Nyeh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Whoa, really?\n"
"You went to the hangar, Himiko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Yes, she did. I definitely saw her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Y-You were watching me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"It's awfully suspicious that you went to\n"
"the hangar last night..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C041_ExOma"
msgid "Okay, then the culprit is Himiko!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"W-Wait! Don't say it's me!\n"
"Maki's more suspicious than I am!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Th-Th-That crossbow came from\n"
"your research lab, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Y-You could've gotten that crossbow \n"
"whenever you wanted!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Anyone could've gone to her research\n"
"lab, though. She's not the only suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"I-I dunno about that!\n"
"She's...d-definitely the most suspicious!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0047 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"E-Even if you make that scary face at \n"
"me...I-I'm not gonna get scared..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Cuz if you start panicking, then we'll\n"
"know that you're the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "I said I'm not the c-culprit! I swear!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"K-Kokichi's the suspicious one!\n"
"M-Maki too! They're both the culprits!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Why am I a suspect? Anyone could've\n"
"entered my research lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I'll admit that I'm suspicious!\n"
"O-kay! Maybe I am the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "I swear I'm not the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C041_ExOma"
