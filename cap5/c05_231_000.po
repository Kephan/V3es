"<CLT=cltMIND>No, that's a question for later.\n"

"If you show the moment of Kaito's death,\n"
"of course it would lead us to believe he died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Even if we can't positively identify the body,\n"
"we would still believe Kaito was the victim."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And that might be exactly the <CLT=cltSTRONG>mistake<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"Kokichi was going for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "D-Does that mean the victims were switched!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Nyeh!? Switched!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Then it was some other dead body that \n"
"got crushed by the hydraulic press?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Where would he even get another body!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"There should be plenty to choose from if\n"
"you reuse the body of a former victim—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"If there was an unknown body, then we\n"
"could guess the victim was switched..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Ah-hahaha, but too bad!\n"
"Switching the victims was impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"The footage showed the body being\n"
"crushed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"When in the footage would they\n"
"have been able to switch the victim?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"And we already established that the \n"
"footage was not doctored in any way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"The camera doesn't have any editing\n"
"functions—just play, record, and pause."

msgctxt "0020 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Monokuma also said that no computer\n"

msgctxt "0021 | C020_Monok"
msgid "Dammit! Me and my big mouth!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Which means, switching out the victim\n"
"would not be possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Also, if the victim was switched, then \n"
"that would mean Kaito is still alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"We already discussed this sooo many times.\n"
"The chance of that happening is imposs—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...It might be possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C041_ExOma"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"There could be a trick to make the switch\n"
"possible. We just haven't noticed it yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C041_ExOma"
msgid "Ooohh, and what trick is that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0030 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"See, you don't know, do you?\n"
"I already said it's imposs—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Maki's not wrong. There is a way\n"
"it could be done..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "So we can't just give up here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0034 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Hey, Shuichi...\n"
"I'll think harder about this as well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"So...can you confirm whether or not the\n"
"victim switched places?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "If Kaito is...alive or not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Maki..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"I don't like the thought that\n"
"I killed Kaito..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "I don't...want that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Okay then, let's talk about the \n"
"possibility that Maki Roll mentioned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Himiko, if you call her that again—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...Yes, please."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Oh... Uh... Okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Then let's all talk it over together!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Together..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C001_Momot"
msgid "And don't forget...you're not alone!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Don't try to do everything yourself.\n"
"It's only gonna wear you out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"When times are hard, you gotta rely\n"
"on your friends."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Yeah...I'm sure we'll figure something out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C041_ExOma"
msgid ""
"Geez, you guys are a stubborn bunch.\n"
"There's no trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C020_Monok"
msgid "That's probably another lie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"However, if the victims were switched, then\n"
"that would mean the footage was <CLT=cltSTRONG>altered<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"How could it have been altered when we know\n"
"that the footage wasn't edited?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"If we could figure that out, maybe we'd know\n"
"how they switched places."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"I knew there was a trick to\n"
"that video the whole time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Kokichi made it, so it's 100% suspicious!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>A trick to that video..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>What could it be?\n"
