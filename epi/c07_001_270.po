"Maybe Tsumugi was just basing\n"

msgctxt "0059 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0061 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "What do you mean, <CLT=cltSTRONG>\"that\"<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That's what Tsumugi said, but...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Even if we were obsessed with this killing game,\n"

msgctxt "0076 | C000_Saiha"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah, but...\n"
"I don't really have any logic behind that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "One of Kaito's hunches, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Anyway, there's no way for us to check when\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "What? We can't check?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"So in the end...we still don't know what\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"The fictional world ends here, and the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "Perhaps just beyond here is the truth..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "But, maybe it isn't..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Maybe it's all still fiction \n"
"in that world, or..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Maybe Danganronpa still continues \n"
"in that world, or..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Or maybe the outside world is the same\n"
"as this world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "It might be a world...filled with lies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Well...if we can get out from here,\n"
"we'll know for sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yeah...but I feel like...there's not too much\n"
"meaning in truth and lies..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Nyeh? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I mean that...even if something\n"
"is a lie, even if it's fiction..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If it has the power to change the world,\n"
"then it must contain some kind of truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Aren't we proof of that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"In this fictional world, we overcame\n"
"all these fictional struggles..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But those things changed us.\n"
"And we were able to change the world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"So it doesn't really matter where\n"
"the truth ends and where the lies begin."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If <CLT=cltSTRONG>lies<CLT=cltNORMAL> can change the world\n"
"just as well as the <CLT=cltSTRONG>truth<CLT=cltNORMAL> can..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Then lies...are just another way\n"
"of telling the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Some lies can lead the world to hope...\n"
"Some truths can lead the world to despair..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"So I don't think anyone can really say which\n"
"is more <CLT=cltSTRONG>right<CLT=cltNORMAL> in the end."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"I guess it's not important whether it's \n"
"a truth or lie. Just what it leads to..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Yeah. That's what I believe."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"We stand with one foot in fiction,\n"
"and one foot in reality..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Then, we need to see for ourselves whether this\n"
"fictional world has changed the outside world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "And what we can do from this point on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"You're right. We can't stay in this \n"
"fictional world forever. It's already over."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"We gotta take all the experience we earned\n"

msgctxt "0110 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Yeah. Let's go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111 | C000_Saiha"
