msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0011 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0012 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0013 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I noticed you also had a spare vest,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C000_Saiha"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0023 | C000_Saiha"

"In short, the shot that Kaede used\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C022_Msuke"
msgid ""
"Th-Then...maybe they just washed off\n"
"the blood!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C000_Saiha"

"If so, the fiber on the shot put ball would\n"

msgid ""

"Rantaro was killed by the mastermind, who\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0056 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"They prepared their own shot to kill Rantaro\n"

msgctxt "0067 | C000_Saiha"

"A time limit is now in effect! If a murder does\n"

msgctxt "0070 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Kaede was keeping us all together, and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"To break up the stalemate, the mastermind\n"
"introduced that motive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"However, this was a gamble. They didn't\n"
"want to cause total chaos, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Because that would just end everything.\n"
"They wanted an exciting killing game..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"That motive put pressure on the mastermind\n"
"as well as us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yes. Kaede had a plan to kill the mastermind,\n"
"but Rantaro was caught in the trap."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"However...her plan ultimately failed. The shot\n"
"put ball that she rolled didn't hit Rantaro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Because it missed, we would've been \n"
"annihilated due to the time limit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"But the mastermind wanted to avoid that\n"
"situation, so they took action."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Thanks to the Nanokumas, the mastermind would\n"
"have known Kaede's intended murder weapon..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"So when her plan failed, they would already\n"
"have another shot put ball prepared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Then, the mastermind manipulated the scene\n"
"to make it look like Kaede succeeded."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"All they had to do was hide Kaede's shot in\n"
"the hidden room that only they could enter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "S-So...Kaede was executed on false charges!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yes...yes, she was.\n"
"She didn't actually kill anyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "But she was executed nonetheless."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Because the mastermind framed\n"
"her for Rantaro's murder!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And Monokuma played along. He let us believe\n"
"the mastermind's lie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"We were all fooled, including Kaede. We thought\n"
"she was the culprit until the very end."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And you want to tell us this game is fair?\n"
"That there are rules? That's all bullshit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "This game makes no sense at all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"If Monokuma twisted the truth for this\n"
"case..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"...then he could've twisted it for the other\n"
"cases as well, making this killing game unfair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Th-Then it's not even a killing game anymore.\n"
"It's just...killing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094 | C020_Monok"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0095 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...I won't forgive them."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""

"And I *will* avenge Kaede!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I swear on her kindess and her love...and\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Yeah! How dare the mastermind create the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"You're the one that blew him up!\n"
"Don't pass the buck!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Anyway, we know the mastermind is also\n"
"Rantaro's killer. Let's figure out who that is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"That is, if Monokuma still wants to\n"
"continue this class trial..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Of course we're gonna keep going!\n"
"Like I said, this killing game will never end!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "No, Monokuma. I will end this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I will reveal the identity of the mastermind\n"

msgctxt "0110 | C010_Haruk"

msgid ""
"If they were involved in Rantaro's\n"

msgctxt "0112 | C012_Shiro"
