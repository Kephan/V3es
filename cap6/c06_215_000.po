msgctxt "0002 | C012_Shiro"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...You said you went to the bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"It's true. I went to the restroom\n"
"closest to the dining hall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "The <CLT=cltSTRONG>girls bathroom near the dining hall<CLT=cltNORMAL>...right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Wh-What did you say!? That bathroom!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Huh? Wh-What? What about it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Shuichi, didn't you investigate the girls\n"
"bathroom? Did you find anything?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "The utility closet in that bathroom..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...has a <CLT=cltSTRONG>hidden passageway<CLT=cltNORMAL>."

msgctxt "0011 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"One that's connected to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>hidden room<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"in the back of the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Which means it's possible to get into the\n"
"hidden room from that bathroom!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Around the time Rantaro was killed, Tsumugi\n"
"went to that exact bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I'm positive that when Rantaro was killed, the\n"
"culprit was in the hidden room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "It's too convenient to be coincidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"H-Hold on. This is all so sudden,\n"
"I don't think I understand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"But...maybe they got there from the \n"
"hidden door in the library instead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "No, I don't think so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Remember that I had placed dust\n"
"in the card reader in the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I was trying to determine if the hidden\n"
"door was opened with the card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But the dust didn't fall. That means\n"
"nobody used that card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"So...to enter the hidden room, they would need\n"
"to use a different route—the girls bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Yes, I believe that's the case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The culprit entered the hidden room from the\n"
"girls bathroom on the first floor..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...and, with the help of Motherkuma, watched\n"
"the situation in the library unfold."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"As soon as they saw that Kaede's plan failed,\n"
"they waited for the camera interval..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"and leaped out of the hidden room,\n"
"shot put ball in hand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The hidden door could open from the inside,\n"
"so there was no need to use the card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"In any case, the culprit attacked Rantaro with\n"
"a shot put ball, left it in the library..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...picked up the shot that Kaede had used,\n"
"and returned to the hidden room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"And they also took the Survivor Perk\n"
"Monopad that Rantaro had, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yes. Then they left the Monopad and the shot in\n"
"the hidden room, headed into the passageway..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...and returned to the girls bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Are you saying the one who did it...\n"
"was Tsumugi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"N-No... It has to be...some kind \n"
"of mistake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Up till now, everything pointed to the\n"
"mastermind *not* being one of us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Is Tsumugi even capable of doing all\n"
"this? She's just a cosplayer, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Y-Yeah! All this would be impossible \n"
"for just some cosplayer!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But *you* said that you went to that bathroom\n"
"during Rantaro's murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "How can you possibly refute that fact?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Refute? It's...it's all just a concidence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Oh! Keebo and Ryoma didn't have alibis. \n"
"What if they went to the girls bathro—"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If one of them had gone into that bathroom,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "But you never mentioned that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Th-That's..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...Tsumugi, what's the meaning of this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C007_Ki-Bo"
