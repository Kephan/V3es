"Whose research lab is this? If it's supposed to\n"
"be mine, then there should be magical items..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Right...? Why are you asking me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Nyeeeh...they mixed up magic tricks and real\n"
"magic. But this is a pretty thorough collection."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"It seems like there are labs for everyone.\n"
"But why prepare so many?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "What *is* this place...?"

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Monokuma said that this <CLT=cltSTRONG>Ultimate Academy for \n"

"Hey... The rooms in the dorms have \n"
"locks, but this research lab doesn't..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Ah, it looks like they're not private."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Are you okay with that, Himiko?\n"
"Your magic tricks might get stolen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"You need skills to perform magic tricks. \n"
"Knowing how they work isn't enough..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"

"To think there was a room like this\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"I wonder why they went out of their way \n"
"to hide it, though."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Oh, sorry... It's probably better to...\n"

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Ah, no, it's fine.\n"
"I'm...okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"

msgctxt "0037"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Don't you know? It's a necessary energy \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Oh, I see. You mean, like ether or life force?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Hm, the names are different depending on \n"
"the school of magic, but I call it mana."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Is that so...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>There's a huge cauldron on the fire...\n"

msgctxt "0048"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "What is this...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"That's the magic trick where the person in the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"It's not a trick...\n"
"That's one of the Space-type spells."

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Space-type?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Ooh, that sounds like high-ranking magic!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Exactly..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"You need a lot of skill for Space-type spells... \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Mhm, mhm. So in other words..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"You couldn't just be a mage, you'd have to be a \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Oh, sorry! I forgot about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"I use that for a number of spells...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Familiar...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Oh, you mean that trick where a dove \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "Er...you mean a magical animal?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Yes, that's right... But my familiar isn't \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I know it's just for a magic trick,\n"
