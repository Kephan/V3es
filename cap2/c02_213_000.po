"Right when I got to the entrance hall,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"That was right after I left Gonta's lab...\n"

msgctxt "0004"

"She started throwing questions at me left\n"
"and right, asking if I was up to no good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"

"She just kept talking...then finally let me go\n"

msgctxt "0007"

"Well, only the first half hour was a lecture,\n"

msgctxt "0017"

"If I am the culprit, that would mean I killed\n"
"Ryoma within five minutes..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"...transported him to the gym, and hid him in\n"

"If you called Ryoma out to the gym and killed\n"

msgctxt "0023"

"Umm...that'd be pretty difficult. We should \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"We narrowed it down to two people, and one\n"

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"Since we don't have to randomly accuse each\n"

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"So, let's find the truth with a more\n"

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "And what is this effective method?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"If one of them is the culprit, then the innocent \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"Because if you know you're not the culprit,\n"
"then you can just accuse the other person."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "Yes, that is true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"

"Have the two argue for their innocence!\n"
"That's how we'll decide our culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"E-Even if we did that, wouldn't they\n"
"just pass the blame back and forth?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "Aaaaand?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"You guys talk about <CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperation<CLT=cltNORMAL> and \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"You're too scared to point your fingers at\n"
"others, so you hide behind the word, \"<CLT=cltSTRONG>trust<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\""

msgctxt "0115"

"How do you expect to find the culprit when\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"If you're planning to expose a liar, then you \n"
