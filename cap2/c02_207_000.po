msgctxt "0001"
msgid ""
"There was a reason the room\n"
"wasn't flooded with water..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>staircase<CLT=cltNORMAL> that was\n"
"attached to the water tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Try to remember how the\n"
"staircase was positioned..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"It was aligned perfectly with\n"
"the tank's escape hatch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Meaning, the water tank was connected\n"
"to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>inside of the staircase<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Inside staircase...\n"
"His body was *in* stairs!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Knowing that, it's clear how Himiko\n"
"made her escape from underwater."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"There was a curtain covering\n"
"the tank during the performance..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"...allowing Himiko to enter the staircase\n"
"from the hatch undetected."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Any water that spilled out would've\n"
"simply funneled into the staircase."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "So how do you get out from the staircase?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"The staircase also has an escape\n"
"hatch, one facing away from us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"It's placed so that the water\n"
"would not drain from the staircase."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"In which case, a person could exit and\n"
"leave water inside the staircase."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"However, that person would be soaked,\n"
"meaning that *some* trace should be left..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"That would explain why there was\n"
"a <CLT=cltSTRONG>puddle<CLT=cltNORMAL> around the stairs..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"So when Himiko came out from the stairs,\n"
"her wet clothes dripped water all over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Haha, bitch! Caught ya soakin' wet\n"
"and red-handed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Nyeh... Nyeeeh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Judging from Himiko's reaction, you hit it\n"
"right on the bull's-eye!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"But...Himiko's clothes should've been wet\n"
"when she left the water tank..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Behold!\n"
"The magnificent Underwater Esca-"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Her clothes were definitely not wet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"O-Of course. That's cuz my Underwater\n"
"Escape wasn't a trick... I-It was magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>No, magic had nothing to do\n"
"with why her clothes weren't wet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "She never went into the water"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Himiko never went into the water\n"
"in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Huh? That's not what you said earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "She dried off quickly"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"She dried herself off so her\n"
"clothes wouldn't be wet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"Do you have evidence to back that up?\n"
"Did you find a hair dryer or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Even then, that wouldn't be enough time\n"
"for her to fully dry her clothes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "She changed her uniform"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Don't tell lies about my magic...\n"
"It was all magic... For real..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>No, magic had nothing to do\n"
"with why her clothes weren't wet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"...It's because she\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>changed her uniform<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"The dormitory is stocked with uniforms. Did\n"
"you hide one behind the stage in advance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Nyeh... Nyeeeh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"I remember seeing Himiko go to the gym this\n"
"morning, carrying a uniform and a towel."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "Nyeeeeeeh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Aaaaahhhhh!!! Why would you say that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"I see. She had a towel, too. She may not\n"
"have had time to fully dry her hair..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"But her short hair and hat\n"
"ensured we were none the wiser."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Himiko can't get wet!\n"
"Cuz her body repels water!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Huh? Like a duck?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Himiko... C'mon. Give it up already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Fine...you win."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"It's just like you said. The water tank\n"
"and staircase both have mechanisms."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "...So I was correct."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "B-But that doesn't mean I used them!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "I didn't need them...cuz I used my magic!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Again with the magic crap...\n"
"Were you dropped on your head as a kid!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Now that we understand how the\n"
"trick was performed, let us move on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Yes, let us proceed. Where did the culprit\n"
"hide Ryoma's body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"From our discussion earlier, his body could \n"
"have been in the space inside the staircase."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"But that's where Himiko would\n"
"escape from, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"So Himiko went in the stairs with the body!?\n"
"What kinda kinky shit is she into!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"That seems unlikely. There isn't enough\n"
"space for two people to fit in there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Yeah, the stairs are pretty cramped. It'd be \n"
"hard to fit even Ryoma and Himiko in there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Who says they went in together? She could've\n"
"made the switch as she was leaving the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"At the same time, she could've pulled out\n"
"the body from inside the stairs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"That way, she'd have room to put herself\n"
"in there. See how easy that is?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"I think that explains how Himiko changed\n"
"places with Ryoma's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Wait a minute! Why did you automatically\n"
"assume it was Himiko!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Who else but Himiko could've done it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "N-Nyeeeh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"Ughhh... Angie, you spent more time with Himiko\n"
"than any of us, so why are you accusing her!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"You may think you're protecting Himiko, but\n"
"what if she really is the culprit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"We'll all die, and it will be all your fault.\n"
"Atua will lose precious devotees."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "...Are you okay with that, Tenko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "I'm totally fine with that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "I don't care what anyone says!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Himiko would *never* murder someone!\n"
"That's what I believe more than anything!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"I *want* to believe in her, no matter what!\n"
"If I can't do that, then I'd rather just die!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"So until this body takes its final breath,\n"
"I'm gonna keep believing in Himiko!!!"
msgstr ""
