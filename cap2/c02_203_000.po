"Maybe Himiko is right... The\n"
"Underwater Escape might be real magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Because from what I've seen, there\n"
"is <CLT=cltSTRONG>no trick or gimmick<CLT=cltNORMAL> in that tank!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Nyeh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Y-Yeah, see? Shuichi agrees...\n"
"There's no trick. It's magic..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Himiko, why do you look so surprised?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Wait up, Shuichi! Why are you trying to\n"
"white-knight your way into Himiko's heart!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Just so you know, Himiko has already chosen me\n"
"as her one and only soulmate!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>That...certainly was\n"
"not my intention..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"But if that trick was actual \"magic,\" then I'm \n"
"more inclined to believe she's the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"If you can perform mysterious miracles, couldn't\n"
"you have just swapped places with Ryoma?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Wh-What...!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"N-No, wait... Ryoma couldn't have been \n"
"killed by the piranhas..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Cuz the piranhas I used in my show\n"
"were special. They <CLT=cltSTRONG>only eat dead flesh<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Only...dead flesh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "...That is a new fact."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"What the—!? Are you just pretending to be nice\n"
"to Himiko so she'll tell us the truth!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Ah, no, that's not it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>But...Himiko's information was useful.\n"
"Ryoma was not killed by the piranhas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>There's one more piece of\n"
"evidence we have that proves that, too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Huuuh? Are you sure it wasn't the piranhas?\n"
"We saw Ryoma reduced to bones!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"He totally died from all the piranhas' \n"
"chomps, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"No, Ryoma's death was not caused\n"
"by the piranhas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"The Monokuma File indicates the <CLT=cltSTRONG>cause of death\n"
"is drowning<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"So it wasn't the piranhas, then.\n"
"He was drowned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Oooohhh, I see. I haven't checked the \n"
"Monokuma File yet, so that's news to me."

msgid ""
"Y-You lying, little brat! Telling lies is what\n"
"turns you into a degenerate male!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Hehe, so what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Ryoma drowned, Himiko changed places with him,\n"
"and then the piranhas ate him. Right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"No, Himiko only had 60 seconds to\n"
"escape from the tank..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Even if they changed places at the start of the\n"
"show, that's insufficient time to drown someone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "If that is the case, then when did he drown?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>When did Ryoma drown?\n"
"It was obviously..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Before the show started"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "During the show"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "Wasn't it during the show?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"As I stated earlier, he could not have\n"
"drowned in such a short period of time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "After the piranhas dropped"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Maybe it was after the piranhas\n"
"dropped into the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"If he was still alive at that point,\n"
"he woulda tried to escape."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"

msgctxt "0043"

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Speaking of when Ryoma drowned..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Ryoma was already drowned\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>before the show started<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Kehehe... Agreed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Before being eaten by the piranhas,\n"
"he made no attempt to escape the water."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"To be precise, he made no movements\n"
"whatsoever."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Yes... By that point, he had already\n"
"joined the ranks of the dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Could that mean his body was hidden until\n"
"the culprit made it appear in the tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Hidden...where?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"The culprit would have had to hide the body\n"
"near the tank, and then show it during the act."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Easier said than done!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Was there a place on stage where the \n"
"culprit could've hid the body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Oh, wait. Himiko should know since she\n"
"performed The Underwater Escape trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Himiko...why won't you just explain it\n"
"to us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "Cuz it's magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Y'know, maybe it really *was* magi—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Shut up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Himiko is committed to her act.\n"
"But those who deal in dreams are oft liars."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Wh-Why is everyone still picking on Himiko!?\n"
"You're all worse than a drunk dad's ramblings!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"We should let him vent. After all, \n"
"it's tough being the man of the house."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Man...we gotta figure out how the trick \n"
"works to find where the body was hidden."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"But Himiko does not wish to tell us how\n"
"she performed her act."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Then let's work together to reveal\n"
"the secret behind Himiko's trick!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "So...not real magic?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid "No, it was real magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Maaagic... Maaaaagic... Maaaaaaaaagic!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Oh, nooooo! It's Himiko's curse!\n"
"Her curses are really powerful!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Aren't incantations usually more,\n"
"um...complicated than that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...Anyway, we first need to\n"
"determine how Himiko performed the trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If we can't figure that out,\n"
"this case is going nowhere."
msgstr ""
