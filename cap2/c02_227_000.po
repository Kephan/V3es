msgctxt "0001"
msgid ""
"It's the <CLT=cltSTRONG>inner tube<CLT=cltNORMAL>! The rubber inner tube\n"
"we found floating in the pool!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "The inner tube?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Remember the inner tube we found in the\n"
"pool, with the rope on one side?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Maybe the rope was originally\n"
"tied on both sides."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The culprit made a ropeway by hanging the\n"
"tube from the rope connecting the windows."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"And because the 3rd floor window is higher up,\n"
"gravity would have pushed the inner tube along."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"The inner tube is made of sturdy rubber\n"
"as well. It could have supported two people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"The culprit used the ropes and the inner\n"
"tube to construct a rudimentary ropeway..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"and used it to move themselves and\n"
"Ryoma's body from the lab to the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Once through the gym window, the culprit\n"
"stood on the inner tube to move the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Either that, or the culprit placed\n"
"their foot on the windowsill."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"That way would be more stable and\n"
"let them handle the corpse more carefully."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Finally, they removed the rope from\n"
"the window frame and left the scene."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Well... When you put it like that,\n"
"it certainly sounds possible..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "But, wow! A ropeway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"You say the culprit placed their foot on the \n"
"windowsill? Isn't that <CLT=cltSTRONG>against school rules<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"It would count as entering the gym,\n"
"would it not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Last time we got asked that question, we\n"
"decided it was <CLT=cltSTRONG>okay<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Stickin' your body through the window is an\n"
"automatic out, but standing on the sill isâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Wait, who asked you last time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "...Eh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"It is quite possible that the culprit went to\n"
"you to confirm the details of their plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "...O-Oh shiiiiit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Way to put your foot in your mouth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"His foot!? Monosuke just unhinged his jaw\n"
"and swallowed his entire leg!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"C-Cut it out! I can't write this off as a joke\n"
"if you two keep freakin' out about it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Nyahahahahaha! Then your little slip-up\n"
"is actually the truth!"

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "P-Pops?"

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Uh-oh... Daddy's mad at you now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "...Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Don't look at me. This is what you get\n"
"for acting like a bigshot all the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Monodam's right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Monosuke, you better thank Monodam!\n"
"Less attitude and more gratitude, got it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Maaan, the trial was just getting fun.\n"
"Why you gotta ruin it with that slip-up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"But I guess now we know Shuichi's logic\n"
"is right on the money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"So culprit really used ropeway\n"
"to move body!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Yeah, they used the ropeway to move \n"
"with the body from window to window."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Ropeway murder...!\n"
"That's some crazy-ass shit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"But if the mechanism was that complicated,\n"
"wouldn't it be hard to put it all away?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "Not necessarily."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"All one must do is detach the rope from \n"
"the window after using the ropeway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Then, after returning to Ryoma's lab,\n"
"one could retrieve the rope from that side."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Tossing the rope into the gym from \n"
"the pool window would be the final step."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"I see, I see! The rope was thrown from the\n"
"window. That's why we found it there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"With that method, the culprit must have made \n"
"numerous trips from Ryoma's lab to the pool..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Which is why the crime was committed \n"
"during nighttime, while we all slumbered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"But if the culprit was so careful to recover\n"
"the rope they used to commit the crime..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Why did they leave the inner tube\n"
"in the pool?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"I believe that was\n"
"an accident."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "An accident?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Yes. When the culprit was taking down\n"
"the inner tube, they accidentally dropped it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Then why did the culprit leave it in the\n"
"pool?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The reason the culprit left it\n"
"in the pool is obvious..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "They don't like water"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"The culprit doesn't\n"
"know how to swim!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"We still don't know who the culprit is,\n"
"so don't just spout off random shit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "There was no time"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"The culprit didn't have enough\n"
"time to collect the inner tube!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"The crime took place during nighttime!\n"
"Of course they had enough time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "It was nighttime"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "They didn't notice it"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"They didn't notice that they\n"
"dropped the inner tube!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Your logic is specious. How could the\n"
"culprit not notice such a thing...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"There is no way our meticulous culprit\n"
"would have left that inner tube behind..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Perhaps your reasoning is flawed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The reason the culprit left it\n"
"in the pool is obvious..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Even if they wanted to get it, they couldn't.\n"
"Because this took place at <CLT=cltSTRONG>nighttime<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"I see, they couldn't get the inner tube because\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>swimming is prohibited<CLT=cltNORMAL> at nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"But couldn't they have used the rope\n"
"to fish it out?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Not necessarily... You see, the \n"
"water level in that pool is so low..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Even if one tried to draw in the \n"
"inner tube using the rope..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"The steep angle the rope would be at\n"
"would make it nigh impossible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"It'd be different if they used a pole,\n"
"but there's no way a rope would work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Even if inner tube was closer to pool edge,\n"
"water still too low to drag tube in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Sounds like a lotta work...\n"
"I can see why they just left it there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Yeah, it would take too long. And they\n"
"would've been busted if someone saw them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Hah! What kinda clumsy dipshit drops an\n"
"inner tube and can't retrieve it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Lemme tell ya, this culprit's a real\n"
"fuckin' amateur!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"No, actually. Save for that one mistake,\n"
"this was the perfect crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"If Maki had never met up with Ryoma at\n"
"nighttime, it might've been the end for us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"Well, I still don't know if Maki is telling the\n"
"truth or not..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "...Shut up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Personally, I find this culprit\n"
"frighteningly thorough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"Such a bold, beautiful plan! I never \n"
"even imagined there was a ropeway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Aaah! Respect begins to bloom in my \n"
"heart for this wonderfully cruel culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"What are you, stupid!?\n"
"Don't respect the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>No, respecting the culprit's intelligence\n"
"is crucial in solving this case..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>We're so close...\n"
"We're just one step away from the truth..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"Now, we just need to figure out who the\n"
"culprit is!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"But, of course. It would be pointless to\n"
"unravel this mystery otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "So, who is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"Hmph. Looks like it's time for me\n"
"to start the main event..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"...but my sidekick here's on a roll\n"
"right now, so I'll let him take this one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Hm? Ah, okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"You're just pushing everything onto Shuichi,\n"
"because you don't know yourself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"Well, Shuichi? Do you already know \n"
"who the culprit is?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Yes...I have a good\n"

msgctxt "0112"

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Hey, Shuichi.\n"
"Are you hesitating again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"C'mon, man. There's no need for that.\n"
"Like I said, you're my sidekick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"I take responsibility for any \n"
"mistakes my sidekick makes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"So use those skills of yours I believe in...\n"
"to shove the truth down their throats!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "You...believe in my detective skills?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"That's right! I'm gonna leave it all\n"
"to you, Shuichi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Yeah...I need to believe in\n"
"my detective work..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>This whole setup would've had to been\n"
"prepared in the gym well beforehand..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Knowing that narrows\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0125"

msgid ""
"Nuh-uh! Between Kirumi and Miu's testimonies,\n"
"my alibi is pretty solid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
