"<CLT=cltSTRONG>No swimming is allowed at nighttime<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\n"

"If Ryoma was drowned in the sink,\n"

"...the <CLT=cltSTRONG>handcuffs<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\n"
"They were scratched as well, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah. It sorta looked like they'd\n"
"been scraped against something."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"There's also the fact that the handcuffs\n"
"were from Ryoma's lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"The marks on the sink came from the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"The size and shape of the scratches are\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Hmmm... How did those handcuffs get from the\n"
"lab to the water tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "Because Ryoma was wearing them, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Yes, though they were only visible for a brief\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"I am certain he was wearing the handcuffs\n"
"at the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"The handcuffs were left after the\n"
"piranhas devoured Ryoma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"So the culprit handcuffed Ryoma and\n"
"drowned him in his lab's sink."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Ryoma must've been pretty yummy. They chomped\n"
"up his entire body—arms, legs, brain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Stop saying disgusting things,\n"
"I don't wanna hear it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"That crunchy texture with the fatty parts just \n"
"right. Then, when they bite down, it gushes—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "STOP, PLEASE STOP!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "But...how did culprit handcuff Ryoma?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"He coulda used Shukuchi Method to get\n"
"away. Unless someone ambush him?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"It's possible they knocked him out\n"
"before handcuffing him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Though there's no way we can \n"
"be sure, now that he's naught but bones."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"I doubt he was ambushed.\n"
"I'm pretty sure the culprit got Ryoma by..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Oh whoops, don't pay attention to little ol' me.\n"

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"When you talk to yourself, pretend you're\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Otherwise, you'll get a mouthful of peanut\n"
"butter squid. It's so disgusting, you'll laugh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"So we all agree Ryoma was drowned in\n"
"the sink in his lab, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"That sink coulda held enough\n"
"water to do it, for sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Alright, I'm calling it! The crime scene is\n"
"Ryoma's fuckin' research lab!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"But how did the culprit carry his body\n"
"to the gym from there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Isn't Ryoma's lab on the 3rd floor of\n"
"the academy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "It's actually not far at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Although, perhaps it's more accurate\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Was there a shortcut...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>What shortcut between Ryoma's lab\n"

msgctxt "0080"

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Eh...? What are you saying...\n"
"all of a sudden?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Are you bein' vague on purpose? When you say\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "The monitor was connected to the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Entering and leaving through the monitor\n"
"would be a mysterious miracle, indeed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"But that goes against the laws of science,\n"

msgid ""
"Do you think the culprit dropped Ryoma's body\n"
