"It's true that you cannot enter the gym at\n"
"nighttime. But a corpse could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"I am positive that the window was\n"
"how the culprit moved the body!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"That window's higher than the piranha\n"
"tank, and it's pretty close by..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"The curtains mighta been closed, but the \n"
"window was open the whole investigation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"That means it was certainly possible to put the\n"
"body in the piranha tank from the window..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"However, I'm also positive the pane dividing\n"
"the piranha tank was set up beforehand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"That certainly couldn't be tossed in.\n"
"It would need to be placed carefully."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Even if the culprit were to throw the body\n"
"from outside the window..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"The window is far too high.\n"
"It cannot be reached from the floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"

"Ryoma was small...\n"
"Gonta coulda chucked him, easy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Yes, but...Gonta wouldn't do that!\n"
"Gentlemen not chuck dead bodies!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Being a gentleman has nothing to do with it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "I know! They used the ladder in the gym!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"You tested it out while you were investigating,\n"
"Shuichi. That ladder reached the window, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"So the culprit just needed to put the body\n"
"through the window to pull it off, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>No, I don't think that method\n"
"is possible. Because..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "The ladder can't be moved"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"I don't think the ladder\n"
"can be moved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Huh? The ladder was easy to move.\n"
"We used it on the stage, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "There was no time to move it"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"I don't think there was enough time\n"
"to remove the ladder..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Couldn't they have carried out the ladder\n"
"at any point during nighttime?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "I think the culprit had enough time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"

msgid "The ladder doesn't reach the window"

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Even with a ladder, it would have been\n"
"impossible in the first place, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"The argument that the body was thrown into\n"
"the tank from the window is wrong altogether."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The ladder couldn't have been used\n"
"like that in this crime. I can prove it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"The only reason the ladder reached the\n"
"window was because it was on the stage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"If you used the ladder on the pool side,\n"
"it would not quite make it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"The ladder could barely reach the\n"
"window when it was on the stage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"And there is nothing on the pool side of\n"
"the gym as tall as the stage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Finally, the ladder was found\n"
"in the gym, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"If the culprit used the ladder on the pool\n"
"side, we wouldn't have found it in the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"And they couldn't have thrown the ladder\n"
"back through the window cuz it's too heavy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Then Gonta used his 'tard strength to throw\n"
"the ladder or the body or...something!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Gentlemen not throw dead bodies!\n"
"Or ladders!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"The body could not have been thrown\n"
"in to the piranha tank to begin with."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"It would need to be placed carefully,\n"
"to prevent the glass pane from shifting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Got it, musclehead!? Even if we injected tons\n"
"of steroids into you, it'd be impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "Sorry. You're right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "You didn't need to apologize, Gonta..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"How the culprit moved the body\n"
"from the window..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Ha! You guys don't even know that!?\n"
"What a bunch of dimwits!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "Do you have the answer, then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "But of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Tell 'em, Shuichi!\n"
"Blow 'em all away with the truth!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Ah...I, uh...actually don't know\n"
"that yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Wh-What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"The culprit definitely moved the body\n"
"through the window, but I don't know how..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "S-Seriously?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Serves you right! You just made a fool out of\n"
"yourself after acting all high and mighty!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Dudes just need to shut up and take\n"
"their licks!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Wh-What are we gonna do, Shuichi!?\n"
"We gotta figure this out or we're done for!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "Hey, you gotta do something, Shuichi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "I-I know...I have to do something, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I don't know what to do,\n"
"I haven't figured that out yet..."

msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Dammit...am I really\n"
"not good enough...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Am I...? Am I no good as\n"
"a detective? I-I can't do this, I can't—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"I don't think it really matters how the body\n"
"got into the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Gonta thinks it matter. We won't know\n"
"culprit's trick unless we figure out—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"We're getting sidetracked. It doesn't matter\n"
"how it was done, just who did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"We shouldn't focus on where we found the\n"
"body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Instead, we need to focus on <CLT=cltSTRONG>where he\n"
"was killed<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Where he was killed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Wouldn't it be more efficient if we focused\n"
"on the murder scene instead?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Yes...that's it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"We were so caught up in where the\n"
"body was found..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"when we should have been thinking\n"
"about where the murder occurred!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"The murder scene would definitely have \n"
"more clues about the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Why didn't anyone realize this yet?\n"
"Ha, that's strange."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Perhaps the culprit steered the \n"
"conversation away from that topic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Th-Then...culprit is someone in this room!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>That's important to remember... It's not as\n"
"if everyone here *wants* us to find the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>One of us is trying to\n"
"sabotage this trial..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Well then, let's discuss the crime scene to\n"
"figure out who the culprit is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"That's not a bad idea for a robot. The \n"
"last time I heard such a good idea was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"...when Nino told me to move in with her\n"
"under the bridge to get out of the cold."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Himikawa Under the Bridge!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If we can determine where this all\n"

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Yes, it's much too soon to quit.\n"
"The trial has only just begun!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "...Thank you, Maki. That was a helpful insight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"I can't believe you didn't notice that. I guess\n"
