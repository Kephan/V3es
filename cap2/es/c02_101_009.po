msgid ""
"But...when the piranhas were dropped and the\n"

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Yeah, that right..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Then when did Ryoma get in there?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "Gonta dunno..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Everyone see Ryoma in tank when piranhas\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"S-Sorry! Gonta shoulda watched tank\n"
"better!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "Y-Yeah. You right..."

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"But...this is a problem...\n"

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Even if Himiko disappearing was part of the\n"

msgid ""
"But...when the piranhas were dropped and the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Since the show was used for the murder,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Perhaps there are clues here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"I never would've imagined such a cruel \n"
"murder happening at such a fun show..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Why did the culprit commit such a \n"
"barbaric act? Did they wish to see us panic?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"I don't think that was the sole motivation.\n"
"There was some other reason for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"And that reason must be related\n"
"to Himiko's magic show somehow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"So that means the culprit knew of Himiko's\n"
"trick and made use of it, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If that's true, did Himiko tell someone?\n"
