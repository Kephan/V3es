msgid ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Yeah, that right..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Then when did Ryoma get in there?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "Gonta dunno..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Everyone see Ryoma in tank when piranhas\n"

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"S-Sorry! Gonta shoulda watched tank\n"

msgctxt "0097"

msgid ""
"But...when the piranhas were dropped and the\n"

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Since the show was used for the murder,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Perhaps there are clues here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"I never would've imagined such a cruel \n"
"murder happening at such a fun show..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Why did the culprit commit such a \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"I don't think that was the sole motivation.\n"
"There was some other reason for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"And that reason must be related\n"
"to Himiko's magic show somehow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"So that means the culprit knew of Himiko's\n"
"trick and made use of it, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If that's true, did Himiko tell someone?\n"
