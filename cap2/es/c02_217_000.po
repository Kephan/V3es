"I might not be able to prove they met,\n"
"but I *can* prove Maki wasn't alone."

msgctxt "0002"

"Well, Kaito and I train together every\n"
"night..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"And yesterday, because of the \"Insect\n"
"Meet and Greet,\" we started late."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Ah, Kaito, don't worry. You\n"
"don't have to say anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Anyway, we were doing some frog squats\n"
"on the school stairs..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "when we heard <CLT=cltSTRONG>two people talking<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "...People talking?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"We knew one of them was Maki, but\n"
"we couldn't pick out the other one..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"But now that I think about it, it must have\n"
"been Ryoma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"U-Uh... Yeah, maybe!\n"
"That was probably...around midnight!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Wait a minute! If you heard their voices,\n"
"then that means..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "So Ryoma and Maki did meet up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"No, no! Hold up! Why'd you sit on that info\n"
"for so long!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Because until just now, I didn't think\n"
"it was relevant."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "I had no reason to bring it up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Now, now... We don't know if Maki was\n"
"really talking to Ryoma, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"That is true. If I knew for certain,\n"
"I would have said so sooner."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"But considering the circumstances,\n"
"I can't imagine it being anyone but Ryoma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"None of us were talking to Maki last\n"
"night, correct? So it must have been him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"And nobody say you suddenly remember \n"
"talking to Maki! It's way too late for that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"And you two did not confirm who Maki\n"
"was talking to at the time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"If I overheard a conversation in the middle\n"
"of the night, I surely would have checked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "We are still part of a killing game, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Wh-Whoa, chill out...\n"
"Why the scary face?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"That was my bad... But it's not really \n"
"manly to eavesdrop, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "I wouldn't do something so uncool..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"...Anyway, I know that we heard\n"
"those voices. Maki is not lying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Then Gonta will believe friends."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Y-You're gonna believe him...just like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "But Shuichi has no reason to lie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Yes...if his lie leads us to the wrong\n"
"culprit, he will join us in eternal sleep."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Unless he wishes for death,\n"
"we should be able to believe him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "That's right, you can believe me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Yeah, you're right!\n"
"I'll believe him too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Belief shall set you free!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"I'd be so surprised if Shuichi was a liar,\n"
"especially after we believed him for so long."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"We wouldn't be able to trust anyone anymore!\n"
"Well, it's not like he's lying anyway..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Alright! That proves it, then!\n"
"Ryoma was still alive during nighttime!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"In other words, me and Maki aren't\n"
"suspects anymore!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"But...I guess that means everyone's\n"
"alibis no longer matter, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "So...everyone is culprit again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"So we're right back where we started...\n"
"What a pain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"However, it should be clear now that the\n"
"crime occurred <CLT=cltSTRONG>after nighttime<CLT=cltNORMAL> began."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"But then when was Ryoma's body placed \n"
"inside the piranha tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Well...the gym is locked at nighttime, so \n"
"it must have been the next morning but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"That's not possible. Himiko and I were\n"
"at the gym, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"So did we fuck up by thinkin' the body\n"
"got stuffed into the piranha tank!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"I don't think so. We have evidence to\n"
"prove that's what happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Then when did the culprit throw the body\n"
"into the piranha tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>When did Ryoma's body\n"
"get placed in the piranha tank...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Maki was with Ryoma around midnight,\n"
"so it couldn't have been before nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>And if it couldn't have been\n"
"the morning after, that leaves..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"The only time they coulda done it \n"
"was <CLT=cltSTRONG>during nighttime<CLT=cltNORMAL>, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Did you forget the gym's not open\n"
"at nighttime, dick cheese?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "D-Dick cheese!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"But that's the only possibility, cuz by\n"
"morning we were already at the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"It may be possible they slipped by\n"
"without you noticing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"No one can slip by me! I'm known far \n"
"and wide as the \"Snoozing Sorceress\"!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "What a terrible title for a guard!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Are you positive that you did not see it? \n"
"You cannot enter the gym at nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Himiko would've seen it! She might strike out,\n"
"but she always keeps her eye on the ball!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "...I don't even play baseball."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"But we can't disobey school rules, right?\n"
"The body was probably moved in the morning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Calm down, everyone! Gonta sure if we\n"
"discuss disagreementâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "...Disagreement?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"What!? A disagreement!? You mean,\n"
"you're split down the middle again!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"Then, the Ultimate Academy is proud to present\n"
"its very own <CLT=cltSTRONG>morphenomenal trial grounds<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "Yippee! We've been waiting for this!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Geez... Do we gotta do that whole\n"
"crazy thing again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It seems like our\n"
"opinions are split on this matter..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>but if we focus on the evidence,\n"
"the facts will become clear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>All I have to do is show\n"
"them and make them accept it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If I can't get them to see the truth\n"
"now, my lie would have been for nothing..."
