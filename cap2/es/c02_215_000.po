"We shouldn't listen to anything Maki says.\n"

"It must have been...a little after midnight\n"
"last night. He visited me at my research lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"He wanted me to show him the motive\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "Motive video?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"If Ryoma came to ask about that, \n"
"does that mean you had his motive video?"

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"As I recall, Ryoma had Maki's motive\n"
"video, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Does this mean you and Ryoma received\n"
"one another's motive video?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Maybe... I actually didn't check the one I got,\n"

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Maki admitted earlier that she hadn't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Then why did Ryoma think that Maki\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"If he went around asking at random, he \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"He never asked me! He probably never\n"
"asked you guys either, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Who told Ryoma that Maki\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"

msgctxt "0041"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Kubs Pads! Gotta catch 'em all! I even got the\n"
"pads belonging to the people who aren't here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... Now everyone can watch their\n"
"motive video!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"So you saw the motive videos.\n"
"Did you tell Ryoma that Maki had his?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"When males get this quiet, they're either\n"
"caught in a lie or thinking dirty thoughts..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"What happened then, Maki? After Ryoma \n"
"asked you for his motive video."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"I told Ryoma just to take it from my room.\n"
"I keep my room unlocked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Wow Maki, that's super careless. Aren't you\n"
"scared someone might kill you in your sleep?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "And then what happened?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"I don't know what happened after that. I'm\n"
"not even sure if he saw his motive video."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"When he asked me, he said that he would\n"
"show me my motive video in return..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"But I wasn't interested, so I declined.\n"
"And that's pretty much it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"So you don't even know if Ryoma saw his\n"
"motive video? What a bunch of crap."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"If Maki met with Ryoma at nighttime,\n"
"that proves he was still alive then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Which means, even though we don't have alibis\n"
"from 8 to 10, Maki and me aren't suspects!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "*If* that story is true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "...It's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Then why did you wait until now\n"
"to bring that up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"I didn't say anything until now because I\n"
"wasn't in the mood to be suspected."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "Suspected? What for?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Kirumi said it earlier."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"It seems that Ryoma and I had each other's \n"
"motive videos..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"That's pretty fishy, right? So I didn't want \n"
"to mention it to avoid suspicion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"You didn't say anything because\n"
"you weren't in the mood?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"It is quite selfish to keep this information \n"
"hidden because you were not in the mood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Well, whatever.\n"
"Either way, let's just believe Maki."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Yes, yes. Those who believe shall be saved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"No, we need to wait.\n"
"There is still more to confirm—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Well then, why don't we ask Kokichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Huh? What now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "You never answered my question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Were you the one who told Ryoma\n"
"that Maki had his motive video?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Is that really important?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Yes, it is important.\n"
"Because if Kokichi told Ryoma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"it becomes more likely that Ryoma\n"
"visited Maki during nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"I see... Kokichi's response may help\n"
"corroborate Maki's testimony."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Now you understand why I don't want\n"
"your charade—I want the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "Well, Kokichi? Did you tell Ryoma?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"You said it earlier. \n"
"\"I don't wanna die,\" right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"If you really don't wanna die, then you\n"
"better tell us the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Here comes the dramatic turnabout...\n"
"Now I'm the one pressured by Maki!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Ooookay, it's true.\n"
"I told Ryoma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "Just as I thought."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"But that's not a bad thing, right?\n"
"He wanted to know, so I told him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid "Have you seen everyone's motive video?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Nope, not yet. I was gonna wait until we \n"
"hosted, like, a movie screening party."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"I just checked who had whose, so I could\n"
"give them back to everyone after."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Hmm...I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Anyway, if Kokichi told Ryoma that,\n"
"then he must've gone to see Maki!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"That means Maki's telling the truth!\n"
"Ryoma was alive during nighttime!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "No, we cannot be too sure about that yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"Even if Ryoma and Maki did meet, it does not\n"
"mean it was during nighttime yesterday."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "...So you still suspect me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "I am saying it could still be a possibility."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"If there is still a small chance of you being\n"
"the culprit, then I cannot trust you entirely."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Because everyone's lives are at stake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"Th-Then...which is it?\n"
"A lie? Or n-not lie?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"She's not lying!\n"
"Can't you tell just by looking at her!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"If it was that easy, we'd be done by now. \n"
"No, this is a world of lies and betrayal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"Himiko, it breaks my heart to hear you say\n"
"depressing things!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"I find Maki's testimony suspicious.\n"
"It's far too...convenient for her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "This is...difficult to determine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"Maki is lying! Like I said before, a liar\n"
"like me knows their own kind!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"I'm not lying. I did meet up with Ryoma\n"
"during nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "...I'm telling the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Is it a lie...or the truth?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>This is the turning point...\n"
"This will change the fate of this case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>And I... I said I would believe in Kaito!\n"
"And that means believing in Maki!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>And *that* means...I have to do it.\n"
"I need us all on the same page..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I have to change where this\n"
"argument is going! Just like Kaede did!"
