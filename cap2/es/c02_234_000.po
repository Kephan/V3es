"The victim's body was found this morning,\n"
"during <CLT=cltSTRONG>Himiko's Underwater Escape Act<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"When we saw the <CLT=cltSTRONG>piranhas<CLT=cltNORMAL> in the tank,\n"
"we thought that Himiko's escape failed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Of course, it was all part of the act.\n"
"Himiko's escape went perfectly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"But when Angie opened the\n"
"curtain in front of the tank..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"we saw Ryoma, with piranhas\n"
"swarming around him!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Before any of us could react,\n"
"the piranhas devoured Ryoma's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"And all that was left were his <CLT=cltSTRONG>bones<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"and the <CLT=cltSTRONG>handcuffs<CLT=cltNORMAL> he was wearing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"That horrifying sight was the <CLT=cltSTRONG>finishing touch<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"on the culprit's own twisted magic trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"The culprit <CLT=cltSTRONG>obfuscated<CLT=cltNORMAL> the time and place of\n"
"the murder, implicating Himiko in the process."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"In truth, the crime began last night,\n"
"around 8:55 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"While preparing for the show in the <CLT=cltSTRONG>gym<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\n"
"the culprit had a chance to be alone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"It was then that the culprit used the\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>ladder<CLT=cltNORMAL> to reach the <CLT=cltSTRONG>piranha tank<CLT=cltNORMAL>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"and removed the <CLT=cltSTRONG>glass lid<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"to put inside the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"They used it as a <CLT=cltSTRONG>partition<CLT=cltNORMAL> to\n"
"force the piranhas to one side of the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Next, the culprit took the <CLT=cltSTRONG>rope<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"from the stage wing in the gym..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"And used the ladder once more, this time\n"
"to climb up to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>gym's window<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Once there, they opened the window and\n"
"tied one end of the rope to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>window frame<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The rope was then thrown out\n"
"the window, toward the pool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"These preparations were key for the\n"
"culprit's elaborate plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"At nighttime, past midnight, the culprit\n"
"asked Ryoma to meet at his <CLT=cltSTRONG>lab<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"All the pieces were in place.\n"
"The culprit was ready to murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"First, the culprit knocked Ryoma out,\n"
"probably striking him from behind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Then, they put the <CLT=cltSTRONG>handcuffs<CLT=cltNORMAL> from\n"
"the shower room on Ryoma's wrists..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"and shoved his head into the\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>sink<CLT=cltNORMAL> filled with water!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"From the water and the pain of drowning,\n"
"Ryoma should've woken up and struggled."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"The culprit anticipated his resistance,\n"
"which is why Ryoma was handcuffed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"The struggle left scrapes on the cuffs\n"
"and sink, but in the end, Ryoma succumbed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Ryoma was dead...but the culprit's\n"
"plan had only just begun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"They removed the <CLT=cltSTRONG>cable<CLT=cltNORMAL> from the tennis net\n"
"and hung it from the window facing the <CLT=cltSTRONG>pool<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"And then, at the pool, they connected the\n"
"wire and the rope from the gym window."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"They returned to the lab\n"
"after picking up one last thing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>rubber inner tube<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"that was in the pool's tool shed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Once back in the lab, the culprit\n"
"pulled the cable, bringing up the rope."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"They pulled until the rope was taut, then\n"
"tied it to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>lab's window frame<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"And thus...the gym and the lab windows\n"
"were <CLT=cltSTRONG>connected<CLT=cltNORMAL> by a single rope!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"After making a <CLT=cltSTRONG>hanger<CLT=cltNORMAL> of sorts with\n"
"another length of rope tied to the inner tube..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"they hung the inner tube on the\n"
"rope connecting the windows."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"That's how the culprit created the <CLT=cltSTRONG>ropeway<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"that was used to move the body!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"An impressive premeditated murder. But,\n"
"the culprit made two crucial <CLT=cltSTRONG>mistakes<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"The culprit got on the inner tube with\n"
"Ryoma's body and slid toward the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"With the height difference between the windows,\n"
"they would have built up quite some speed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"To avoid crashing through the window,\n"
"the culprit used a <CLT=cltSTRONG>brake<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"They used <CLT=cltSTRONG>their own hand<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"to grip the rope and slow down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"That would have caused significant rope\n"
"burn...had the culprit not been wearing <CLT=cltSTRONG>gloves<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"But due to the friction, <CLT=cltSTRONG>part of a glove<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"tore off and dropped in the pool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Regardless, the culprit reached the window\n"
"and put Ryoma's body into the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"The glass pane not only kept the piranhas\n"
"and the body separated..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"it also kept the piranhas so close\n"
"together, they concealed the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"After that, all the culprit had to do was\n"
"untie the rope and the inner tube..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"but that's when they made\n"
"their second mistake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"One end of the rope came loose, and\n"
"the inner tube dropped into the pool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Thus, the culprit was forced to leave two key\n"
"pieces of evidenceâ€”the <CLT=cltSTRONG>fabric<CLT=cltNORMAL> and the <CLT=cltSTRONG>inner tube<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"They couldn't retrieve the evidence because\n"
"of the <CLT=cltSTRONG>rule against swimming at nighttime<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"And that's the whole story.\n"
"Am I wrong, <CLT=cltSTRONG>Kirumi Tojo, the Ultimate Maid<CLT=cltNORMAL>!?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"

"What was used as a partition\n"
"in the piranha tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
