msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"

msgctxt "0008"

"When I woke up, there was a Kubs Pad in my \n"

"Tsumugi, we should discuss this once\n"
"everyone is here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "Oh, sorry... You're right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "What do you mean, once everyone is here?"

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Kaito and Keebo went to gather everyone \n"

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Wh-What do you mean? Are you also suggesting\n"
"that I cannot read the air?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "So what is it? Why did you drag us here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Didn't I tell you?\n"
"It's about the Kubs Pads."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Monokuma gave us a new motive.\n"
"We can't *not* talk about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"That thing that looks like another Monopad?\n"
"That was a <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Maki, haven't you watched the video on the\n"
"Kubs Pad yet!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"No. I ignored it because I figured it was\n"
"something stupid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"That's actually really courageous \n"
"in a weird sort of way..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"You don't have to speak up, but this is\n"
"important, so you should at least listen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "So, what are these videos?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"No doubt they're more <CLT=cltSTRONG>motives<CLT=cltNORMAL> from Monokuma,\n"
"but why were they all mixed up...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Y-Yeah! Why Gonta get Tsumugi's video—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "No! Don't say it, Gonta!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "...Hm?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Aah...I heard it... I see... \n"
"So Gonta has my video..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "...Huh? Gonta not supposed to say it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Who fuckin' cares!? We're gonna exchange 'em\n"
"anyway, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "No, we cannot exchange them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>What? We can't?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Why not? They're videos of the \n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>most important people<CLT=cltNORMAL> in our lives."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"And that is precisely why we cannot exchange\n"
"them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Although we do not know why our <CLT=cltSTRONG>motives<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"were mixed up..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"As long as we don't exchange them, we don't\n"
"have to see our motives at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "So it's better to just ignore them..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "Yes. At least, that is what I think."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Th-That's true... If we ignore them, then we\n"
"won't have a <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive<CLT=cltNORMAL>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "I'm against that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Huh? Against it? Why? If you see that video, \n"
"it'll turn into a <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive<CLT=cltNORMAL>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "That's why I want to see it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "You do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"You were saying something like that before...\n"
"That you don't plan on surviving."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"It might not matter to you whether \n"
"you get killed or not, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"We're different!\n"
"We all want to live!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Wake up already! You're like some zombie\n"
"wandering around with no will to live!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"No will to live, huh? Hmph, if that's \n"
"how you see me, then so be it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"But I've got no plans to change my opinion.\n"
"That's just not cool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "Wh-What did you say!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Who cares? Ryoma just stated his opinion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid "Actually...I feel the same way as him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Are you...trying to cause trouble again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not saying\n"
"we shouldn't care about killing or dying..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"But I think it'd be better if we didn't <CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperate<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"with each other..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Actually, we *definitely* shouldn't <CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperate<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"with each other!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "We shouldn't cooperate? Why not!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Think back to all of Monokuma's actions so far."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Whenever we tried to work together, Monokuma\n"
"would retaliate with a plan to make us suffer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"It happened when Kaede wanted us to cooperate,\n"
"and again with these <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive videos<CLT=cltNORMAL>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Which means, the more we try to cooperate,\n"
"the more he'll try to make us suffer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"You are saying that if we do not rally together,\n"
"we will not be made to suffer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"That's why I had no choice but to screw with\n"
"you guys. But you ingrates didn't even notice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "And you're not lying to us right now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"...Whether I'm lying or not, what I'm saying is\n"
"still true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Anyway, we shouldn't force ourselves to \n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperate<CLT=cltNORMAL>. Let's just all do our own thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "So, I agree with Ryoma's suggestion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It's *because* we're trying to cooperate\n"
"that Monokuma is making us suffer...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>But what about...\n"
"everything we went through...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>What was the point of Kaede\n"
"sacrificing herself...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Anyway, I'm warning you all for your sake."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Let's just exchange our <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive videos<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"instead of cooperating with each other."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "...I cannot comprehend that logic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Well, now that I've said I won't cooperate, I\n"
"can't afford to be seen with you losers..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "C'mon, Gonta. Let's go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "What? Gonta, too!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"We promised to think of a way to get everyone\n"
"to exchange their <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive videos<CLT=cltNORMAL>, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Anyway, Kirumi, I'll hit you up later when I'm\n"
"feeling hungry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "W-Wait! Did Gonta make promise!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Why can't you tell when he's lying, Gonta?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Quit screwing around... \"Our sake\"?\n"
"Yeah, right. I've had it with his lies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "So are we all done here? Then I'm leaving."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "Kirumi, bring me my dinner later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid "I'm heading out too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "Wait up, Ryoma!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Don't forget. We're all struggling to get out \n"
"of here alive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "So don't get in our way..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"I've got no intention of getting in your way.\n"
"I'd never do something so uncool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"Kirumi, could I get you to clean \n"
"my room later?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "You guys are relying on Kirumi too much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"I do not mind... Serving others is the true\n"
"desire of any maid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"You shouldn't spoil people, though!\n"
"Especially degenerate males!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Our cooperation is the number one factor \n"
"in our suffering, is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... How, I wonder, will this turn out...?\n"
"I will observe with great interest..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Oh, and Kirumi, I shall have you record my\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"

"Hah-hahaha! Well, I'm certainly not gonna\n"

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"Guess I'll go back, take a shit, and get some\n"
"sleep! Kirumi, think of an invention for me, okay!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"Wow... How much is everyone going \n"
"to depend on Kirumi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"My workload has increased significantly...\n"
"This calls for a more tactical approach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
