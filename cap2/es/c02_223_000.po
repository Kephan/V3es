"So...during nighttime, someone used the \n"

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"So they *did* use the rope! That's how they\n"
"bridged the distance between both windows!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Is the rope long enough to reach both windows?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"The rope is roughly <CLT=cltSTRONG>65 feet<CLT=cltNORMAL> in length.\n"
"As for the distance between the windows..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"According to the sign at the pool, the width\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"and the distance from the edges of the pool\n"
"to the windows is an additional 16 feet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"

"Altogether, the sum total length from one\n"
"window to the other is roughly <CLT=cltSTRONG>50 feet<CLT=cltNORMAL>."

msgctxt "0048"

msgctxt "0049"

"You bet it's long enough!\n"
"Heh! That's what she said!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "Wait... Who said that...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Even if the rope was long enough, wouldn't it\n"
"be pretty hard to tie them to the windows?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Both windows were too high to reach. It would \n"
"be like tying a rope from one cliff to another."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"If the windows were closer together, then they\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"

"No! Gonta think it would work!\n"

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>No, I'm sure there was another rope. Or at least,\n"

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"If you connected a bunch of\n"

msgctxt "0059"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"

"There was that piece of fabric\n"

msgctxt "0070"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>tennis net cable<CLT=cltNORMAL> from Ryoma's lab\n"
"could serve as a rope..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "How long is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"About 50 feet or so.\n"
"But how did they use it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Okay, so..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"First, culprit hang rope outside of one\n"
"window. Then culprit move to other side..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "...and tie cable to other window."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Then, after tying to each window, culprit\n"
"tie rope and cable together..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"That how culprit make one rope that\n"

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Wow! That's amazing, Gonta!\n"
"You're so knowledgeable!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"I-It's nothing. Gonta use ropes a lot\n"
"when looking for bugs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Even if they did connect the windows with a \n"
"rope, they can't carry a body on just that."

msgid ""
"Thomas Edison once said that genius is\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "We get it, just tell us already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"They handcuffed the body to the rope and slid\n"
"it from one window to the other like Tarzan!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"The body would reach the gym window,\n"
"but it wouldn't land in the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Stop making such dumbass comments, and keep\n"
"your smelly breath in your dirty mouth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "Ahhhhhhhhh, ah-ah-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "Tarzan!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Um, but...they also had to put the body in\n"
"the piranha tank after they moved it, huh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "That is not feasible with just one rope."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"Maybe the rope wasn't the only equipment\n"
"the culprit used!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Not just the rope...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"Well anyway, it would've been pretty\n"
"difficult to get that body in the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"They wouldn't just throw it. The trick was\n"
"a super crucial part of the culprit's plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"The culprit must've carefully placed the body\n"
"into the tank with their own hands."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "But is there really a way to do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "Kokichi...are you hinting at something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""

"with your talk of hinting hints."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>You're confusing *me*!\n"
"You were definitely on to something..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It's true that the culprit needed to place\n"
"the body directly into the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If the body were to fall, the culprit\n"
"would not have been able to retrieve it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>They would have only had\n"
"one shot at it, no second chances..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>So obviously, the culprit would have wanted\n"
"to put the body in the tank carefully..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Meaning they would have wanted to\n"
"get as close to the window as possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The problem is...how\n"
"did they get near it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>All that we know right now is that there\n"
"was a rope that connected the windows..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Somehow, the culprit used that to move the body\n"
"and were close to the window themselves."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>To make that work, they\n"
"had to have used something else..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>But what would that be?\n"
"What could they have doneâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Alright, Shuichi...\n"
"The stage is finally set."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "...What?"
