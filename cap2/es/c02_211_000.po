"Kiyo's hypothesis is correct. The \n"
"body and the piranhas were <CLT=cltSTRONG>separated<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"This was accomplished using the\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>square glass pane<CLT=cltNORMAL> found in the tank!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Kehehe... Just as I thought."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Using that glass pane as a divider, a safe \n"
"space could be created in the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"It is in such a space that the body could \n"
"be stored, separated from the piranhas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Then that means Ryoma's body was hidden\n"
"in the piranha tank the whole time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"So Ryoma's body fell into the water\n"
"tank with the piranhas!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "Gonta knew it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "What is it, Gonta?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Gonta was above stage when piranhas fall!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"That's why Gonta see something\n"
"no one else could..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"When piranhas fell, Gonta see some big\n"
"thing fall into water tank with them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Right when the timer hit zero,\n"
"the buzzer went off..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>And then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The bottom of the suspended tank swung open,\n"
"and the murky water and shadowy shapes inside..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>fell straight into the water tank\n"
"Himiko was swimming in!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Huh? Huhhh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Y'know, now that Gonta think about it...\n"
"Gonta maybe see Ryoma's body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"When the piranhas dropped from the tank, I \n"
"thought I saw something bigger drop as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"The water tank on the bottom is made \n"
"completely out of glass, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"You can see what is happening through the \n"
"glass. Can you really hide a body in the tank?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Even in murky water, a dead body\n"
"would still be visible in a glass tank!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Unless...a <CLT=cltSTRONG>certain something<CLT=cltNORMAL> was used \n"
"to obscure the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "...A certain something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"We all agree that the glass pane was used to\n"
"separate the body from the piranhas, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Well, that method has the added benefit\n"
"of <CLT=cltSTRONG>hiding the body<CLT=cltNORMAL> from view."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Nyeh? How could you hide a body like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>How was the culprit able\n"
"to conceal the body in the piranha tank...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"The glass itself\n"
"served as a shroud."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Huh? Isn't glass see-through?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"How do you hide body behind something\n"

"There's...a trick to the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"

"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"You seem to be at a loss for words. Maybe\n"
"hiding the body was impossible, after all."

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"What exactly was obscuring\n"
"the body from view?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"...It was the <CLT=cltSTRONG>piranhas<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\n"
"The piranhas were obscuring the body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "Huh!? The piranhas!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"That's right. Remember what Angie said\n"
"during the investigation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "I noticed it right as the show started..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"I feel like there are more piranhas today\n"
"than yesterday when we were preparing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"They increased *that* significantly!?\n"
"I didn't know piranhas fuck like rabbits!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"It seemed that way, but it wasn't that\n"
"the actual number of piranhas increased."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"The glass pane divided the tank\n"
"nearly in half, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"The piranhas got crowded together, making it\n"
"look like there were more of them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"The more densely the piranhas are packed, \n"
"the harder it is to see past them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Because of that, it was difficult to\n"
"see the body hidden in the tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"That glass pane was...the lid from\n"
"the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"It was really easy to detach that lid, so \n"
"it's no wonder they used it as a divider."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "Gee, thanks for telling us that useless detail!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"What the heck are you saying!? That detail\n"
"was super useful!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Sure, the lid looks a little big. But if you\n"
"set it diagonally, it would fit perfectly..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Nice job, Himiko!\n"
"Your explanation was awesome!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"With this much evidence, it seems like\n"
"the body was definitely in the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Congrats, Himiko! Now there should be no\n"
"reason for anyone to suspect you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Nyeh...? Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Yeah! Cuz if you didn't switch places with the\n"
"body, then you couldn't have killed him!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"It only means we now have other suspects.\n"
"You are not cleared of suspicion just yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Okay, but still, that's way better!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"That's wonderful news, Himiko!\n"
"Atua is happy for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Apologize, Angie! You and your Atua better\n"
"tell Himiko you're sorry right now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Atua is sleeping. He went to bed angry\n"
"cuz you all doubted Him..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "What a petty-ass god!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"No, it's okay...\n"
"We shouldn't be mad at Angie..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"We should be mad at this class trial...\n"
"At this killing game..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Oooohhh, Himiko!\n"
"Bless your sweet, kind heart!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "That's what Atua said, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Whaâ€”!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"It's too bad that the handsome god\n"
"went to bed angry, though..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Himiko's still brainwashed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"B-But I'm not giving up just yet!\n"
"This is gonna be a breeze!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Great, now what're we gonna do!?\n"
"We're back to square one!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "And why are we back to square one?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Cuz any of us could still be the culprit! Geez!\n"
"You flunk outta 'tard school or something!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Nuh-uuuhh! Not everyooone! We can narrow it\n"
"down to whoever doesn't have an alibi yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "...Eh? What alibi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"I guess I should've known a dumb whore pig like\n"
"you wouldn't understand, so lemme explain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "Who you callin' a dumb pig!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"If there's this much evidence, then there's no\n"
"mistake the body was hidden in the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"But for someone to plant the body in there \n"
"with such limited time is pretty tricky..."

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""

msgid "Yesterday, during nighttime"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "Nope! Wrooooong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Huh? Even Shuichi doesn't know? It should be\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"Is this the best the Ultimate Detective can do?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"W-Wait... How do you know it was before\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "B-Bitchlet!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"First, the gym was closed during nighttime,\n"
"so no one could've entered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"Cuz if you try to enter the gym at night,\n"
"it'll go off!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid "You talking 'bout my butthole?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "No, she means the alarm!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"After nighttime passed, morning came.\n"
"But hiding the body before the show was..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Nyahahaha! Impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Himiko and I were waiting in front of the gym,\n"
"before the morning announcement."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"Which leaves only one possibilityâ€”it was\n"
"done before <CLT=cltSTRONG>nighttime yesterday<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"Anyone who doesn't get this is just as \n"
"stupid as the whore bitchlet over there!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "Ahh... Ahhhh...!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"So the culprit placed Ryoma's corpse in the\n"
"piranha tank before nighttime yesterday?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"Which means, he was also killed during that\n"
"timeframe."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"Yay! Now we know what time\n"
"the crime happened, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"

msgctxt "0123"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"

"What clue helps determine\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"Kirumi, you were asking everyone\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid "Yes, Gonta was the last person who saw Ryoma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid "What? Really!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid ""
"And when was the last time Gonta saw\n"
"Ryoma!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"Ummm... When Gonta was inviting everyone\n"
"to \"<CLT=cltSTRONG>Insect Meet and Greet<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\" so..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid "...Gonta think that was maybe <CLT=cltSTRONG>8:00 p.m.<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"If he was last seen at 8:00 p.m. and was\n"
"killed before nighttime officially began..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"Then we can assume the crime took place between\n"
"8 o'clock and 10 o'clock at night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"So all we must do...is find someone with\n"
"no alibi for that time period, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid ""
"Simple enough. After all, most of us\n"
"were...detained by Gonta then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid ""
"If I recall correctly...the only people that\n"
"weren't there besides Ryoma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid ""
"That would be the four of usâ€”myself, Kaito,\n"
"Miu, and also...Maki."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid ""
"Wow, Kirumi. You would tell the truth,\n"
"even if it screwed you over."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0150"
msgid ""
"I do this for everyone. It is my duty to unveil\n"
"the truth, so I do not care if people suspect me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0151"
msgid ""
"Aah! Beautiful! Your spirit of self-sacrifice \n"
"is just too beautiful!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0152"
msgid "I will also say this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0153"
msgid ""
"The crime took place between 8 and 10 o'clock\n"
"at night, and I was at the gym during that time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0154"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...Hm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0155"
msgid "But, I was only there for about five minutes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0156"
msgid ""
"Why would you even say that though? You're\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0157"
msgid ""
"I don't care if it was five seconds! It's way\n"
"too suspicious that you were alone in the gym!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0158"
msgid ""
"I think the cleaning lady here is the culprit!\n"
"You killed Ryoma, didn't you!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0159"
msgid ""
"I-Is too soon to tell. We should hear\n"
"what everyone has to say, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0160"
msgid "Fuck that noise!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0161"
msgid ""
"But, Miu, you don't have an alibi for when\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0162"
msgid ""
"Y-You think I'm suspicious?\n"
"I...don't even know where the gym is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0163"
msgid ""
"Doesn't telling such obvious lies\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0164"
msgid ""
"The other two without alibis are Kaito \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0165"
msgid ""
"I was in my research lab the whole time. \n"
"I didn't go to the gym."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0166"
msgid "But that cannot be proven, can it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0167"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0168"
msgid ""
"What about Kaito? Only murderers grow out\n"
"creepy facial hair like mustaches and goatees."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0169"
msgid ""
"Wh-What!? My goatee's not creepy!\n"
"It gives me a glamorous celebrity vibe!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0170"
msgid ""
"Anyway, among those four, the culprit must\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0171"
msgid ""
"...I apologize but given the circumstances, we\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0173"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0174"
msgid ""
"Oh wait, I remember now...\n"
"I...do have an alibi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0175"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0176"
msgid "I'm not the culprit!"
