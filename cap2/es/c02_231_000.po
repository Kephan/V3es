"You only suspect me because I was at the\n"

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"But there is no evidence to indicate that\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"No, there is. I have proof that you're\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"If it was indeed Kirumi who moved the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"

msgctxt "0124"
