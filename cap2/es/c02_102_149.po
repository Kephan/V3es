"Hmm, so this is Himiko's research lab.\n"
"What were we gonna investigate, again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"The trick that Himiko used in her magic show.\n"
"...I need to figure out how it worked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"Well, you say that, but what if it was\n"
"real <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic<CLT=cltNORMAL>, with no tricks or mechanisms?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "...Well, that would be a problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>But it's not just about\n"
"the trick..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>I need to ask that guy some questions."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Even if it's to solve this case,\n"
"revealing Himiko's tricks is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "Well, it makes things...kinda boring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Huh? Kaito, are you the type who wants \n"
"to believe in magic?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "Ooh! Kaito believes in Himiko's <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "That's not what I mean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"I was just thinking that her tricks are\n"
"like <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic<CLT=cltNORMAL> that brings smiles to people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Ah, yeah. I guess you could think about it \n"
"that way..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Besides, it's just like my dream to go to space!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"I believe I can travel across the Milky Way!\n"
"I believe I will meet aliens!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Flying around space with thoughts like that\n"
"is the true spirit of adventure!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid "Aah, so it's like that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Kaito, that's..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"...the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Your\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Hey! Who you callin' stupid!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "Ah, n-no need to yell..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"I know it's not actually <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\n"
"Anyway, let's just start the investigation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Hey, Shuichi.\n"
"Did you wanna ask me something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"I'll tell you aaaanything you wanna know.\n"
"You are my favorite, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>When he says that, it sounds like he means\n"
"the opposite. It makes me nervous..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"I do, actually. It's about when we\n"
"were kidnapped by Gonta yesterday."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"You snuck into our rooms to\n"
"steal our <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive videos<CLT=cltNORMAL>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"But is that *all* you were doing?\n"
"You came back pretty late."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"I see... You wanna know my alibi for nightime\n"
"yesterday. That's a good question to ask."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"The gym is off-limits during nighttime, so Ryoma\n"
"was probably killed before or after..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Which makes nighttime yesterday so suspicious,\n"
"since everyone was doing their own thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "And what were you doing then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"It'd be easier if I just explained, step by step,\n"
"what happened while I was out last night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"After you regained consciousness, Shuichi,\n"
"Gonta brought Himiko and Angie..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "That was about five minutes before 9 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Right after that, I left Gonta's lab\n"
"and headed toward the dorms."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"I thought I'd be back in an hour—the start of\n"
"nighttime—but something happened..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "Something happened?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Right when I got to the entrance hall,\n"
"Kirumi spotted me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"That was right after I left Gonta's lab...\n"
"so it was right around 9 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"She started throwing questions at me left\n"
"and right, asking if I was up to no good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Then she started criticizing my behavior, and\n"
"lecturing me on my manners and relationships..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Can you believe that? I mean, who does she\n"
"think she is—my mom or something!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Didn't you ask Kirumi to\n"
"\"be your mom\" earlier?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"She just kept talking...then finally let me go\n"
"at 10:00 p.m., when nighttime rolled around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "...A whole hour?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Well, only the first half hour was a lecture,\n"
"then we played tag for the other half."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"She was starting to bore me so I turned\n"
"around to leave, and then..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Stop right there... Our conversation is not\n"
"over yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"I don't gotta listen to you! You're not worthy of\n"
"lecturing the <CLT=cltSTRONG>Ultimate Supreme Leader<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "C'mon, Miss Maid! Catch me if you can!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Is that...a request?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"And then...I guess Kirumi decided to take\n"
"tag super seriously..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"I tried my best, but in the end, she caught\n"
"me a little before 10 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Then she started lecturing me again, and\n"
"let me go when nighttime started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"So do your alibis still hold up, even when\n"
"she was chasing you around?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"We ran into each other a bunch of times,\n"
"so yeah, they should hold up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Then from 9:00 p.m. until nighttime,\n"
"both Kokichi and Kirumi have alibis."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"After Kirumi let me go, I finally went to the\n"
"dorms and collected everyone's videos."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"But by the time I returned to Gonta's lab,\n"
"it was already 11 p.m."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Then from ten to eleven,\n"
"he doesn't have an alibi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah... I did see something odd while\n"
"Kirumi was lecturing me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "...Something odd?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"I saw a half-naked girl, wandering around\n"
"the courtyard in her underwear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"It was too dark for me to make out who it\n"
"was, but I saw her walk around for a bit."

msgctxt "0066"
msgid "I wonder who it was..."

"By the way...you didn't get captured by Gonta\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "Where were you? And what were you doing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
