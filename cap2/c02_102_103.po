"This is Ryoma's room, huh?\n"
"So where's his video?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"I don't see it sitting out anywhere.\n"
"Maybe he put it on his bookcase?"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Kaito opened all the drawers one by one,\n"
"checking each of them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid "Hm? That's weird...I can't find it anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"I see...so we can't find it.\n"
"That's alright..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "That's a clue in itself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "Huh? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"You see, if we suppose the motive for\n"
"the crime was the video..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"There's a high possibility that Ryoma had\n"
"the culprit's motive video."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"If their motive video was left at the scene,\n"
"they would be immediately suspicious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"There's no reason the culprit would leave\n"
"behind that kind of incriminating evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "That's true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "And the video is not in the room, which means..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"So it's just like we thought!\n"
"That video was the motive!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Yes, that's the best explanation I can think of."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Alright! That's just what I'd expect\n"
"from my top sidekick!"

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "What's the matter, Shuichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Ah, nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "By the way, I was thinking..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Maybe we all should've watched those\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>motive videos<CLT=cltNORMAL> after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid "...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"They showed the most important\n"
"people to us, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "So...maybe we should've watched them..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "Without looking away from the truth..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"At the time, I agreed with Keebo, but after\n"
"thinking about it...I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"And...if we were worried about watching them\n"
"alone, we coulda just watched them together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Watch them together?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Yeah...we shoulda gathered together and watched\n"
"all the videos. Share everybody's motives."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Even if it's something you can't bear by \n"
"yourself, it'd be possible with everyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "That's what <CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperation<CLT=cltNORMAL> is, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "That's...what Kokichi was trying to do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Kokichi was trying to get us to participate\n"
"in a motive video viewing party of sorts."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "That's why he forced us into the same room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Do you think that was his way of \"<CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperating<CLT=cltNORMAL>\"?\n"
"Do you think the same way?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"N-No...if that's what he wanted,\n"
"he coulda just asked us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"That's what a normal person woulda done,\n"
"but the thing is, he's *not* normal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"Maybe he did want us to cooperate, but there's\n"
"no way to know for sure. He'd never tell us."

msgctxt "0040"

"<CLT=cltMIND>That's true... It's impossible to know\n"

msgctxt "0041"

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Kokichi's just not normal...\n"
"Geez, what a pain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
