"Maybe we can't prove everyone's alibi,\n"
"but we can still pinpoint the culprit."

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "...How so?"

msgid ""
"Last night, Kaito and I heard Maki\n"
"speaking with Ryoma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"But I haven't mentioned what happened\n"
"after. Kirumi...any thoughts?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Did you return to your respective \n"
"dorm rooms?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Yes, we did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"But I couldn't fall asleep...\n"
"so I was awake until morning!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Which allowed me to hear a\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>certain sound<CLT=cltNORMAL> in the night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid "A-A certain sound?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Last night, I heard the sound of someone\n"
"leaving their room and exiting the dorm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"And after some time...I heard the sound\n"
"of them returning."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Could it have been...the culprit!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"But all you heard was a sound? That doesn't\n"
"mean you know who made it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Indeed, it doesn't. But...I didn't hear\n"
"the <CLT=cltSTRONG>sound of someone going down the stairs<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"Which must mean that whoever left\n"
"has a <CLT=cltSTRONG>room on the 1st floor<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"No one on the 2nd floor left the dorm\n"
"that night."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"So everyone on the 2nd floor has an alibi?\n"
"You cannot determine the culprit with just that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"On the contrary, once we rule out the\n"
"2nd floor, we know who the culprit is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Because preparing the ropeway required\n"
"time to be spent in the gym..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"it's extremely likely that the culprit\n"
"helped set up the magic show."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "In short...Himiko, Angie, Kaito, or Kirumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"I see... So among the four, the only one with\n"
"a room on the 1st floor of the dorms is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Yes. Only Kirumi."

msgctxt "0025"

"<CLT=cltMIND>It wasn't very elegant, but my <CLT=cltSTRONG>lie<CLT=cltMIND> \n"
"was certainly plausible. Will they buy it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"Hmm, you heard a sound, huh?\n"
"Well, I hear a load of BS."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"But unfortunately for you, Kirumi...\n"
"Your time's up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"We already know you're the only one\n"
"capable of setting all this up."

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "Riiiiight, Shuichi?"

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...Well, that was\n"
"an unexpected assist."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Right... The only person who could have\n"
"prepared this murder is Kirumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"No...the only person who could have\n"
"prepared this murder is Kirumi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Well, the preparations in the\n"
"gym, in any case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid "And why do you believe that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Before the culprit could put the body into the\n"
"tank, several steps needed to be taken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Like tying the rope to the gym window, and\n"
"putting a partition in the piranha tank!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"That's right. Ryoma's body entered the gym\n"
"from the window, but that required preparation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"That could only have been done when Kirumi\n"
"was by herself in the gym before nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"But Kirumi was alone in the gym for only, like,\n"
"five minutes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Not enough time for the whole murder,\n"
"but enough time to set it up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Enough time to tie the rope on the window\n"
"frame and put the pane in the piranha tank."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"While I do understand where you are \n"
"coming from, I assure you this is just..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"...a part of your petty imagination!\n"
"An empty theory created from nihilism!"
