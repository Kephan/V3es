msgctxt "0001 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Wait a minute!\n"
"I don't think Rantaro was the mastermind!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | C001_Momot"
msgid "Huh!? Why!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Because, Rantaro didn't have the \n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>card key<CLT=cltSTRONG> to open the hidden door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"You'd think the mastermind would have\n"
"that card key on him, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Perhaps the culprit took the card key\n"
"after killing Rantaro?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But none of the pictures show Rantaro holding\n"
"the card key."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "So I don't really think he had the key at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Also, if the mastermind had died there,\n"
"this killing game would've already ended."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C008_Tojo_"
msgid ""
"You are correct... The possibility of him\n"
"being the mastermind is quite low."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Then how Rantaro know about\n"
"hidden door...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Maybe he stumbled across it in the library?\n"
"Y'know, like how Shuichi did?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"Or maybe the mastermind \n"
"told him about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C013_Yonag"
msgid ""
"Whaaaat? Why would the mastermind\n"
"tell him that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid "To <CLT=cltSTRONG>lure<CLT=cltNORMAL> Rantaro to the library...and kill him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Does that mean the culprit and the\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>mastermind<CLT=cltNORMAL> are one in the same!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C006_Shing"
msgid "Hmm... That does seem plausible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"It's very likely the mastermind knew \n"
"about Kaede and Shuichi's <CLT=cltSTRONG>trap<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"The mastermind knew about our trap this \n"
"whole time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"This case may have become the perfect\n"
"crime, thanks to your <CLT=cltSTRONG>hidden cameras<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"The mastermind knew about your trap and\n"
"exploited it to commit their crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"So after the mastermind lured Rantaro\n"
"and murdered his ass..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"they used Kaediot and Poo-ichi's hidden\n"
"cameras to arrange the perfect crime!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Did they really take advantage of our\n"
"trap though?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Is this really...the perfect crime?\n"
"Are we in an unsolvable mystery?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "I guess this is a dead end..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Wait, don't give up that easily! We already \n"
"know the culprit is the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"We gotta work together to find the mastermind!\n"
"Then we can end this killing game!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"You yap about teamwork and all that, but \n"
"you still think one of us is the mastermind..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Yes, and I know that's a horrible thought..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"But that's why I want to end all the\n"
"terrible things happening to us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"I'll defeat the mastermind and end \n"
"this dumb killing game!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C015_Akama"
msgid "I'll...I'll even use this class trial to do that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Kaede..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... Wow, looks like you're determined\n"
"to face even a <CLT=cltSTRONG>cold, hard truth<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "Then here it comesâ€”the cold, hard truth!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "I already figured out who killed Rantaro."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C020_Monok"
msgid "Wh-What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "Why are you surprised?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Cuz if he's right, that would make this\n"
"the fastest class trial to date!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C021_Mtaro"
msgid ""
"How fast was the previous record,\n"
"anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C022_Msuke"
msgid "Real fast, lemme tell ya."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C023_Mfunn"
msgid "He was like...a leaf on the wind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C021_Mtaro"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah... I guess now he's\n"
"one with the wind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C022_Msuke"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I think about him this time\n"
"of year, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C025_Mkid_"
msgid ""
"The way he soared through the enemy fleet\n"
"all badass, just to die like a li'l punk!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Shut it, you weirdos! This is \n"
"an important conversation!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Kokichi! Are you serious about\n"
"knowing who the culprit is?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Yup! Soooo...we all agree that the culprit\n"
"knew about Kaede and Shuichi's trap, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"No shit! That's why they're not in any\n"
"of the pictures! So who is it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"So whoever knew about the hidden cameras\n"
"is the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "So who the hell is it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "It's you!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Moi!?!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"You made the cameras used for the trap!\n"
"Riiight?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Obviously, whoever made the cameras \n"
"knew about the blind spots."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"Before breakfast was the only time\n"
"someone would be able to sneak by."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Wh-What the hell brought this\n"
"on all of a sudden...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"I...I just designed the cameras... I didn't\n"
"know they'd get set up in the library..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"If someone asked me to make cameras,\n"
"I'd totally ask what they were for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C013_Yonag"
msgid ""
"How come you never asked what the\n"
"cameras were for? Huh? Huhhhh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"I...I...I pulled an all-nighter makin' them...\n"
"and afterward, just sorta...passed out..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"You're getting awfully worked up.\n"
"Look at you, you're sweating."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"I'm always wet! I'm just feelin' extra\n"
"sensitive, like these big boobs of mine..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"For someone so aggressive, you're kind\n"
"of a wimp, huh, Miu?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"C-C'mon, lemme off the hook already...\n"
"D-D-Do you want money!? Is that it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067 | C011_Chaba"
msgid ""
"Your pathetic excuses are consistent with\n"
"those of a common male criminal!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068 | C015_Akama"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's starting to suspect Miu, but..."
msgstr ""
