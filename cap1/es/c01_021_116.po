"...and have cameras that will <CLT=cltSTRONG>detect movement\n"
"and take pictures<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If we set up a few in the library,\n"
"we can capture proof of the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And we don't have to be in the library for this\n"
"to work, so we are less likely to get caught."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Th-That's a really good idea...\n"
"But do you know how to modify a camera?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Ah, well...I don't know how..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That's why...I wanted to ask Miu.\n"

msgctxt "0088 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Oh, yeah. That's true."

msgctxt "0089 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0090 | C015_Akama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C000_Saiha"

"I think she'll still be there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092 | C000_Saiha"
