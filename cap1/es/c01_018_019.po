"Alright, I'll explain everything.\n"
"First, take a look at the card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>As Shuichi said that, he moved the bookcase\n"
"to reveal the hidden door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>I peeked into the gap of the card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C015_Akama"
msgid "The dust is gone!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That's right. I checked it right after nighttime\n"
"started yesterday, and the dust was there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "But this morning, it was gone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"So that means...someone entered this door\n"
"during nighttime?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That got me thinking.\n"
"This may sound far-fetched, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Perhaps Monokuma's revival is related\n"
"to this door somehow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C015_Akama"
msgid "How so?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Remember what the Monokubs said?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C022_Msuke"
msgid ""
"This school...has a machine somewhere that\n"
"can make a whole lotta Pops."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C022_Msuke"
msgid ""
"Just activate that machine, and you can have\n"
"as many spare Pops as you waâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Um...so there's a machine that can build\n"
"spare Monokumas?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That would explain why we saw Monokuma\n"
"alive and well in the morning..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"At nighttime, <CLT=cltSTRONG>someone<CLT=cltNORMAL> went through\n"
"this door and activated the machine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And then there's what Monokuma\n"
"just told us..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"A time limit is now in effect! If a murder does\n"
"not occur by <CLT=cltSTRONG>nighttime, two days from now<CLT=cltNORMAL>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"then every student forced to participate\n"
"in this killing game will die!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The way he phrased it seemed peculiar.\n"
"Why not just say \"everyone will die\"?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"He went out of his way to specify that\n"
"students \"forced to participate\" will die."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Huh? But why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"My deduction is that one of us <CLT=cltSTRONG>volunteered\n"
"to participate<CLT=cltNORMAL> and wasn't <CLT=cltSTRONG>forced<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That would mean that they would avoid\n"
"execution without breaking any rules."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Perhaps that's why Monokuma\n"
"said it that way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"And that person is the one in our group\n"
"who's <CLT=cltSTRONG>cooperating with Monokuma<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I don't know if Monokuma is *that* strict with\n"
"rules, but if he is trying to protect someone..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...that would imply that they're doing more\n"
"than just cooperating with Monokuma."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C015_Akama"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I believe that if one of us can create spare\n"
"Monokumas..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"They are the <CLT=cltSTRONG>mastermind<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"of this killing game."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"So, the person who's responsible for all our\n"
"suffering...is one of us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Of course, this is just what I've deduced,\n"
"but it is entirely possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That's why I didn't want to talk about\n"
"this in front of everyone..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If we told them now, they might all try to\n"
"find the mastermind, and be led to murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "That's why...I could only tell you, Kaede."
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0038 | chara_Blank"

"<CLT=cltMIND>The mastermind...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I can't believe the person responsible for\n"
"our suffering could be among us..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>It's hard to accept, but if it's true..."

msgctxt "0041 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>I can't forgive them..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"So...what do you plan to do now, Shuichi?\n"
"We're gonna find this mastermind, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I'm...thinking of taking the risk,\n"
"just before time expires."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I believe the mastermind will come here just\n"
"before time is up, and I can expose them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Wait, how do you know they'll come here\n"
"right before time's up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I'm extrapolating from something\n"
"Monokuma told us earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C020_Monok"
msgid ""
"Mauled to shreds by countless Monokumas\n"
"from the rumored Monokuma-making machine!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"To produce a large number of Monokumas,\n"
"the mastermind would have to come here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"They would have to get into the hidden\n"
"room to activate the machine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Of course, none of this is certain.\n"
"There's a chance the mastermind won't show."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Like I said...it's a risk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But I'm willing to take it. It's better than\n"
"just sitting around, waiting to die."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C015_Akama"
msgid "I'll take that risk with you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah, but...Kaede, this is just *my* deduction,\n"
"it's possible that I'm wrong..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I know.\n"
"But I've made up my mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"You told me about this, so that must mean\n"
"you trust me, right, Shuichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Then...I'll trust you, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0060 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"...I mean, I don't have a good idea of my own\n"
"so obviously I'll help you with yours."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Okay, then! Let's expose the mastermind\n"
"together, Shuichi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Thank you, Kaede.\n"
"You...have a way of encouraging me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C015_Akama"
msgid "I never expected this to happen, though..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"I can't believe our enemy is within our group,\n"
"hiding in plain sight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...Yeah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""

"<CLT=cltSTRONG>everyone<CLT=cltNORMAL> needs to work together..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"But whoever the mastermind is, we'll expose\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068 | C015_Akama"

msgctxt "0070 | chara_Blank"

"<CLT=cltMIND>After we re-applied the dust to the card \n"

msgctxt "0071 | chara_Blank"
