msgctxt "0001 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Sorry I'm late, Shuichi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah, it's alright.\n"
"I just got here too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C015_Akama"
msgid "How did it go? Did Miu finish the cameras?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"She must have been working all night. She\n"
"was even too tired to make fun of me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Anyway, here's the result."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Two cameras that will take a picture\n"
"when the sensor detects movement..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And this one will take a picture *and*\n"
"trigger this receiver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Of course, they're turned off right now,\n"
"so they aren't taking any pictures..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Since they're disposable cameras, we'll\n"
"have to manually wind the film, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yes, Miu thought of that. She told me that\n"
"the cameras will wind automatically."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"So once they're set up, they'll take pictures\n"
"every time the sensor is triggered?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"She also modified them so that they'll be\n"
"completely silent, to not attract attention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C015_Akama"
msgid "They're completely silent... This is perfect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"It needs to be...\n"
"These are absolutely essential to our plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C015_Akama"
msgid "And do these cameras have flashes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yeah, they still have flashes on them, but I\n"
"switched them off. They shouldn't be a problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But, we need to make *sure* they don't get\n"
"turned on by accident and alert the mastermind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Yeah, I'll be careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"I'm impressed, though. Miu modified them\n"
"to our specifications."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Alright, I'll tell you a little bit about this\n"
"classroom before we set up in the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Huh? Tell me about this classroom?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yes, I think this is the perfect place to\n"
"keep watch after we set up the cameras."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C015_Akama"
msgid "That's fine, but why this classroom?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Because we can see anyone who goes down\n"
"to the basement. With the door open a little..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Look. You can see the staircase, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah, you're right! We can keep a lookout\n"
"for anyone who goes down to the basement!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"There's one more reason I chose\n"
"this specific classroom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>One more reason?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"It's because of something...\n"
"Something that's only here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Anyway, it's time. We should set up\n"
"the cameras now..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>I wonder what that one reason is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | chara_Blank"
msgid "Yes"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | chara_Blank"
msgid "No"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | chara_Blank"
msgid "Are you unsure of something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltSYSTEM>Would you like to leave?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."

msgctxt "0040 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Is this...a vent?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"It's connected to the library in the basement.\n"
"You'll recognize the smell immediately."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C015_Akama"
msgid "The smell?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>After Shuichi told me that, I leaned in\n"
"closer to the ventâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Oh! It smells like musty old books!\n"
"Does this lead to the library?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"It's probably a vent to control\n"
"the humidity in the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Remember the duct we noticed in the\n"
"basement hallway? It leads here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"But a vent in a classroom? That's an odd\n"
"design choice for a school..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Then again, everything about this school\n"
"is odd..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"This vent is the other reason I chose\n"
"this specific classroom to keep watch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"This vent is just big enough for someone to be\n"
"able to fit, so we should watch this carefully too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"I don't think I could fit through there...\n"
"Well, maybe I could but it'd be tough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Well, I guess this is the perfect spot to\n"
"keep a lookout."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Anyway, it's time. We should set up\n"
"the cameras now..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>It's finally time to set our plan in motion..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I'm getting nervous...\n"
"Ngh, my heart is racing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>There's a vent that connects to the library\n"
"from here. I didn't even notice that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>This doesn't seem like the other reason..."
msgstr ""
