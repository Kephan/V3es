msgctxt "0006 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0080 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0085 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"I'll organize the books on top of the bookcase\n"

msgctxt "0106 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Looks like there are too many books after all.\n"
"You can't really make space, can you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"It'd be easier if I could move them to the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Yeah... We have to minimize any risk of the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109 | C015_Akama"

"Then I guess it'd be better to put the camera\n"

msgctxt "0114 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Arghhh! And here I thought it'd be a\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "So, about the places to put the cameras..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"We decided to place the security sensor\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...and the camera linked to it will be\n"
"set up right here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That way, it will capture the moment\n"
"the mastermind moves the bookcase."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"We're gonna place the other two cameras\n"

msgctxt "0120 | C000_Saiha"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0122 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Yeah, sounds good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123 | C015_Akama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124 | C015_Akama"

msgid ""
"Let me take care of the security\n"

msgctxt "0135 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "I'm finished too."

msgctxt "0136 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Now, no matter which entrance they use,\n"
"the mastermind will be caught on camera."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And if they move the bookcase in front of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...and signal this receiver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139 | C015_Akama"
