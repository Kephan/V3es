msgctxt "0030 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I think it might.\n"

msgctxt "0031 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0033 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0036 | C015_Akama"

msgctxt "0037 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"It's only a hypothesis right now, but...\n"
"consider this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Why *would* there be a hidden door here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If it were solely for Monokuma's use,\n"
"he wouldn't need to hide it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"He could just have the Monokubs or the\n"
"Exisals protect it and keep it in plain sight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"However...I can think of one reason\n"
"that the door would be hidden."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"For one of us to sneak in and use it,\n"
"without anyone else noticing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Maybe, but...I can't believe someone in our\n"
"group could be working with Monokuma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I can't believe it either.\n"
"That's why...to confirm my suspicions..."
msgstr ""

"I decided to set a little trap\n"
"on this card reader."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I sprinkled some dust inside the card\n"
"reader, so that I could tell if it was used."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Of course, I was careful to make sure\n"
"the dust wouldn't come loose accidentally."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"And I don't think the person swiping their\n"
"card would notice or care about a little dust."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"So if we see dust on the floor, it means one\n"
"of us used this door, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Well...as I mentioned before, this is just\n"
"a hypothesis. I have no evidence yet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "But...if it is true..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C000_Saiha"

"<CLT=cltMIND>After putting the moving bookcase back\n"

msgctxt "0059 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Is this...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C000_Saiha"
