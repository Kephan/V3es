msgctxt "0060 | C015_Akama"

msgctxt "0062 | C015_Akama"
msgid "But...at the same time, I thought..."

msgctxt "0063 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"If I did this for everyone, then instead of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C015_Akama"

"I thought I should lie to you all, so it would\n"

msgctxt "0065 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0072 | C015_Akama"

"I never wanted to keep my crime a secret...\n"
"I was going to tell you all eventually..."

msgctxt "0073 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"But before I did, I wanted to expose the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C015_Akama"

msgctxt "0079 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0080 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0082 | C006_Shing"

msgctxt "0084 | C005_Oma__"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C005_Oma__"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I wanted to protect Kaede, but I\n"

msgctxt "0089 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"But even when the killer was about\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"That has to mean that the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C001_Momot"

msgctxt "0094 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0095 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0105 | C007_Ki-Bo"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106 | C001_Momot"
