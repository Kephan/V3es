msgid ""
"The culprit met him inside the library?\n"
"That doesn't seem possible though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"Let's hear it, then. \n"
"What's your reason?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"If you take a look at the <CLT=cltSTRONG>three pictures<CLT=cltNORMAL> from\n"
"the camera we placed near the front door..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"This is when Shuichi and I met up with \n"
"Kaito and Tenko, and then rushed in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"This one shows the other four people running\n"
"in after they heard Tenko scream."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"And finally, everyone else coming in after \n"
"hearing the body discovery announcement."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"You can clearly see everyone entering\n"
"the library in these pictures."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"It wouldn't make sense if there was someone \n"
"hiding in the library the whole time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"Well... That does cover everyone, \n"
"now doesn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"I guess the one who still has \n"
"a ways to go...is me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Don't worry about it. It's better to think\n"
"about each possibility anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Right, Shuichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Hm? Ah, um, yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C015_Akama"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Is Shuichi okay?\n"
"He's been really quiet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C015_Akama"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Is he worried about something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C008_Tojo_"
msgid ""
"So the real question is how the culprit\n"
"entered and exited the library."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"We cannot continue until we address\n"
"that problem first!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"It's quite the mystery. How did the killer \n"
"avoid being caught by the cameras?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "It's almost like they were invisible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Oh, but it wasn't me. My magic \n"
"can only make you half-invisible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "...Your upper half, to be specific."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"That's kind of a half-baked \n"
"invisibility spell, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"But both doors to library had\n"
"hidden cameras on them..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"How about the vent in the library?\n"
"Maybe they came in through there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"But Shuichi and I were on lookout in the\n"
"classroom with the connecting vent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"The culprit waited until Kaede and Shuichi \n"
"weren't looking...then turned invisible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C011_Chaba"
msgid ""
"Himiko is really gung-ho about her invisible\n"
"culprit theory!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Ummm...yeah, no. There's no way someone\n"
"snuck into the library through the vent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>That's right... We have evidence that proves\n"
"that would've been impossible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"If the culprit had gone through the vent, they\n"
"would've set off the security sensor!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"The security sensor reacts if the bookcase\n"

"There's no evidence that anyone used\n"
"the classroom vent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""

"What is the evidence that proves no one\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"When I set the cameras, I also <CLT=cltSTRONG>stacked \n"
"some books<CLT=cltNORMAL> in front of the vent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"If someone did crawl in and out from the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"While we were investigating, they were still\n"
"neatly stacked the way I placed them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Maybe they put the books back\n"
"when they left the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C008_Tojo_"
msgid ""
"That would be quite difficult to achieve\n"
"on such a narrow bookcase..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C013_Yonag"
msgid ""
"If we've ruled out the vent and doors, then\n"
"how'd the culprit get in and out of the library?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | C013_Yonag"
msgid "Maybe...divine intervention!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Gonta no can think of any other way\n"
"to enter..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Eureka! I know how the culprit got\n"
"in the libraryâ€”the front door!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Um... Have you been paying attention?\n"
"The camera would've taken their picture."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Not if the culprit timed their movements\n"
"around the <CLT=cltSTRONG>camera intervals<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Huh? Intervals?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "What is that...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Basically, the culprit knew about the\n"
"cameras and their intervals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"So they snuck into the library between camera\n"
"shots! To avoid appearing in the photos!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Hyah-hahahahaha! I know, I know...\n"
"Beauty *and* brains? Why, it's just not fair!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Miu! What's this interval you're talking\n"
"about!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Huh? Oh, *now* you're asking me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"After the shutter snaps, the camera can't\n"
"take a new photo for 30 seconds."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Cuz I redesigned the cameras to auto-roll\n"
"the film instead of having to do it manually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"That's the first time I'm hearing about this!\n"
"Why didn't you tell us from the start!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Heeeeeeeeeee!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"B-But...I told your little beta boytoy after\n"
"I gave you the remodeled cameras..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073 | C015_Akama"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Sh-Shuichi...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah! I-I'm...I'm sorry!\n"
"I-I guess...I forgot to tell you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076 | C015_Akama"
msgid "How could you forget to tell me...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I didn't think it would affect the plan.\n"
"I-I didn't realize it would matter..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"I guess I just forgot to mention it...\n"
"I'm really sorry..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... \"I forgot.\"\n"
"What a pitiful excuse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "Yeaaah, that's pretty much a lie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"N-No, it's not a lie...\n"
"He probably just forgot..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"There was so much going on at the time...\n"
"it's only natural to forget, you know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Y-Yeah..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C002_Hoshi"
msgid ""
"Let's put that aside for now and\n"
"talk about the camera intervals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C008_Tojo_"
msgid ""
"Each interval lasted for 30 seconds,\n"
"correct, Miu?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Yeah, sure, I'll explain it again to you\n"
"mush heads..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"The three cameras that Kaediot and Poo-ichi\n"
"placed go off when they pick up movement..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"From there, it takes 30 seconds for the film\n"
"to auto-roll to the next photo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"So, for 30 seconds, anyone could've entered\n"
"the library without their photo being taken!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090 | C008_Tojo_"
msgid ""
"That may have been enough time to kill \n"
"Rantaro and exit the library..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C011_Chaba"
msgid ""
"It's definitely enough time! You just gotta\n"
"move at lightning speed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092 | C013_Yonag"
msgid ""
"I see, I see! Then there's no doubt the\n"
"culprit made use of the cameras' intervals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"That means the culprit was Miu all along!\n"
"Since she knew about the intervals!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"D-Don't be an asshole! I have an alibi!\n"
"Remember, the dining hall!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Oh yeaaaah. Welp, heh heh...who else knew\n"
"about the intervals?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "Hmmm... Now who was it again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...Shuichi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "...A-Ah!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Well then, does this mean that\n"
"he is the culprit we have been seeking?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Sh-Shuichi...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101 | C001_Momot"
msgid "Hey! What gives, Shuichi!? "
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0104 | C006_Shing"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0111 | C015_Akama"
