msgctxt "0034 | C015_Akama"

msgctxt "0035 | C015_Akama"
msgid "I think that's pretty impressive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0037 | C015_Akama"
msgid "What other cases do you get?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The other cases are just stuff like...finding\n"
"runaways and stuff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C015_Akama"
msgid ""
"Ooh! That could be part of an even bigger\n"

"Ah, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but those\n"
"cases are rarely connected to crimes..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0042 | C015_Akama"
msgid "After they're found?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C000_Saiha"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C015_Akama"
msgid "Detectives have to follow up with them, too?"
