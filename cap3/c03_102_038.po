"So...Kokichi tells me you wish to participate \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Kehehe... You are most welcome to join us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"...Is what I would like to say. However, only\n"

"Aw maaan, what a shame.\n"
"Well, Kee-boy, you're out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "...Why me!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"...I agree with Kokichi.\n"
"I was thinking this for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Robots and seances don't mix! They're like\n"
"toothpaste and orange juice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"To be honest, I had the same thought.\n"
"Your help was appreciated...Keebo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"D-Don't any of you feel guilty for kicking me\n"
"out after forcing me to come?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "That's why we're apologizing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "No one's apologized yet!"

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Fine, fine, our bad... Just don't get mad and\n"

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0015"

msgctxt "0016"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>What did *I* do?"

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Do not enter the magic circle that I've \n"
"drawn on the floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"It is drawn with purifying salt, so it is \n"
"easily disturbed when stepped upon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "You drew this magic circle with salt?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"I always use salt for magic circles.\n"
"It makes seances more likely to succeed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Also, it's dark in here, so be sure \n"
"to watch your step."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"If the magic circle is broken,\n"
"not only will the seance fail..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid "But it may also unleash a curse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "G-Got it... I'll be careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"I'm surprised you were able to draw this\n"
"without even looking at the picture..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"I have the entire document memorized,\n"
"so this magic circle should be perfect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Of course, I also have <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL>'s song\n"
"memorized. You must do the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"I have copied the words to the song \n"
"down here. Please commit it to memory."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"Everyone else has already memorized it.\n"
"After all, you'll be unable to read in the dark."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid "We have to memorize the lyrics now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"You're a detective, so I expect your memory\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I listened to Kiyo sing the song and did\n"

msgctxt "0034"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Your memory is extraordinary.\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Well then, let us begin the ritual right away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Yaaaay! We finally get to see Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Before that, let's choose a spiritual\n"
"medium. It would work best with a girl..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Then I'll do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"I can't think of anyone but me\n"
"that Angie's spirit should go in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid "...No, I'll do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Because if you're the spirit medium, you\n"
"won't be able to talk to Angie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid "Nyeh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"You wanna talk to Angie, right?\n"
"Then I'll be the spirit medium..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "That way, you can say goodbye to her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"And after you've finished saying your\n"
"goodbyes..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Keep your chin up and live life facing forward!\n"
"Survive with me and everyone else!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid "...Please."

msgctxt "0049"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Tenko..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0051"
msgid "Also...Himiko, let me say this one thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Expressing your feelings is perfectly natural.\n"
"You shouldn't feel ashamed at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"So...if you feel like crying while you're talking\n"
"to Angie, go ahead and cry your eyes out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid "...You'll feel better when you do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Well, I mean...laughing makes you feel \n"
"better too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"And venting your anger onto something\n"
"can really cheer you up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Train your heart by crying, laughing,\n"
"and venting your anger, Himiko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "I think you've trained too much..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "Hahaha, you're probably right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It seems like the two of them\n"
"made up... That's good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"So now that we've decided on a spiritual\n"
"medium, let us begin."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid "Alright, Himiko! I'll see you later!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Now I would like the spirit medium, \n"
"Tenko, to sit within the center circle..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Please be sure to walk on the path, \n"
"so as not to disturb the magic circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Mm-hm... Make sure you watch your step\n"
"since it's so dark in here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"Next, you must be as a turtle \n"
"within that circle..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Please rest your forehead upon this\n"
"stone marker I've placed here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"It's just a stone I brought from the courtyard.\n"
"Are you sure it'll work?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Certainly. It is merely needed as a \n"
"marker for her forehead to rest upon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Um...like this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"This may be uncomfortable, but please \n"
"endure it until the seance is complete."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Whatever you do, you mustn't raise \n"
"your head or change positions."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Piece of cake! I have 5-star flexibility!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Starting now, the rest of us must go to work.\n"
"There are many things left to be done."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"First, we must place this iron cage atop Tenko.\n"
"I shall leave that to Shuichi and Kokichi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"And please keep in mind...walk carefully\n"
"so as not to disturb the magic circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"O-kay, you can count on me! I may not look like\n"
"it, but I'm actually super duper strong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"U-Ugh...I shouldn't have lied...\n"
"I'm way too weak...for this kinda stuff..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "It's made of iron, no wonder it's heavy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "Hold on! Don't just drop it on top of me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"I-I know... It wouldn't be very funny if a body\n"
"discovery announcement happened during this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "Please don't jinx us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Phew, I'm tired. So next, we cover the \n"
"basket with a white cloth, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "I shall take that role."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Alright, everything is prepared.\n"
"Tenko...how are you doing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Well... I can only see the floor from this \n"
"position, but I think I'm fine!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"The final step is to place the wooden \n"
"statue of the Dog God atop the cage..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"The four of us may need to do this \n"
"together. The statue is quite heavy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "Nyeeeh! Nyeeeh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"E-Even with four people...\n"
"it's still really heavy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "Krgh! Holy crap, this weighs a ton!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"No...it is not much more \n"
"than 175 pounds..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "Phew, I'm totally wiped."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"I coulda used my magic to carry it \n"
"easily...but seances and magic don't mix."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"Are you sure it's okay to put something\n"
"so heavy on top of the cage?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"The iron cage was made specifically \n"
"for seances, so it can hold this weight."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "Okay...I guess that's fine then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Now, let us exit the magic circle. \n"
"Take care to avoid disturbing it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"This is the point of no return, Tenko.\n"
"After this point, you mustn't speak."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"The next time you open your mouth,\n"
"it will be Angie speaking through you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"Understood. I will not say a word until\n"
"the seance is over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"Okay, everyone!\n"
"I'll see you guys after the seance!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"The rest of us shall move to the corners of \n"
"the room. Please go to one of your choosing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>We each stood in a different corner..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"Now we darken the room. Kokichi and \n"
"Shuichi are closest to the candles."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"Please blow out the candles. You should \n"
"be able to follow the walls in the dark."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"So, go back to the corner of the room after\n"
"it's dark... O-kay, got it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"You needn't move, Himiko. There are\n"
"many gaps in the floor near you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "Nyeh... Got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"Once the room is dark, I will begin \n"
"the song. Please sing along with me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"Then, I will call out to Angie. Until \n"
"she replies, there must be silence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"After the seance is done, Shuichi and I are \n"
"supposed to light the candles again, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"Correct. I brought matches from the \n"
"warehouse, so please use those."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "Okie-dokie! Then I'll blow out the candle now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
