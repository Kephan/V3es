msgid ""
"That's right... The floorboard might have\n"
"been used as a <CLT=cltSTRONG>seesaw<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Nyeh? A seesaw?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"The crosspiece at one end of the\n"
"floorboard had been cut off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"The other two crosspieces holding up\n"
"that board were close to the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Meaning, if you were to apply force to the\n"
"end of the floorboard with no crosspiece..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"...the next crosspiece would act as a fulcrum\n"
"to turn the floorboard into a lever."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"A lever capable of lifting up\n"
"Tenko's entire body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "Her whole body...lifted up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Yeah, that sounds like a seesaw, alright...\n"
"But why bother lifting Tenko's body?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"They couldn't have killed Tenko like \n"
"that...unless they used the <CLT=cltSTRONG>sickle<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"That's exactly it. Using the seesaw trick,\n"
"it was possible to kill Tenko with the sickle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Huh? How?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"In order for the culprit to kill Tenko\n"
"with the seesaw trick..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"...the <CLT=cltSTRONG>placement of the sickle<CLT=cltNORAML> is the\n"
"most important factor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The floorboard seesaw, the cage,\n"
"and the blood on the white fabric..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>What conclusions can I\n"
"draw from this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>There's only one place the sickle could\n"
"have been that is consistent with the evidence..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Next to the cage"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "The sickle was set up next to the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Would it really be able to kill\n"
"Tenko if it was placed there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Also, she probably would\n"
"have noticed it there, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid "Underneath the floorboard"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Perhaps the sickle was attached to\n"
"the underside of the floorboard?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Under the floorboard...? The floorboard\n"
"woulda had to flip for it to hit her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "The top of the cage"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Between the victim and the floorboard"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Perhaps the seesaw motion caused the\n"
"sickle to pop up from the floorboard?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"If it was there, Tenko would have\n"
"seen it from the start..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Huh? What's wrong?\n"
"Weren't you going to tell us?"

msgctxt "0034"

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Where was the sickle when\n"
"Tenko was killed...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"The sickle was at the top of the <CLT=cltSTRONG>iron cage<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\n"
"with the blade facing down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"The reason we didn't see it was\n"
"because of the fabric covering the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Also, the wooden statue kept\n"
"the blade in place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"It's true that the sickle's handle was thick,\n"
"which made the statue wobble..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"but the statue's weight kept it\n"
"from falling over."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Once everything was in place, if you\n"
"stepped hard enough on the seesaw..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"Tenko's body would have shot upward\n"
"and hit the blade on the top of the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"She was bent over, meaning the sickle's\n"
"blade would have connected with her neck."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"The 6-inch sickle blade wasn't long enough \n"
"to stab Tenko in her crouched position."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"But with the floorboard acting as a seesaw,\n"
"it could compensate for the blade's length."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Bringing the victim to the sickle, rather than\n"
"bringing the sickle to the victim..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "That's definitely an unorthodox idea!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"It's crazy, but it would explain how Tenko \n"
"got stabbed while she was in the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"So the sound we heard was the \n"
"culprit stomping on the floorboard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "That impact make floorboard come loose."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Looks like we got ourselves a good\n"
"ol' fashioned seesaw homicide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"...Wait, what the hell's a seesaw homicide!?\n"
"That's fucking crazy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"The craziness is what really makes the\n"
"killing game fun, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"They can't get away with murder the normal\n"
"way, so they gotta think outside the box."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Kudos, culprit!\n"
"You did a great job keeping me entertained!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid "Indeed... Well played, Himiko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Nyeeeh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... It was you, wasn't it?\n"
"The one behind this <CLT=cltSTRONG>seesaw homicide<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid "Huh!? Why her!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"Because she's the only one capable\n"
"of carrying out this plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "The only one? Why's that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Because this seesaw homicide required\n"
"its location to be prepared beforehand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"By cutting the crosspiece beneath the\n"
"floorboard, you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Then the culprit would need to lure\n"
"their victim into the prepared room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"That is why you chose that room\n"
"for the seance, is it not, Himiko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"However...there are three empty rooms.\n"
"Which one shall we use?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"Um...the middle room. The middle \n"
"room's always best for stuff like this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah! Himiko was the one who chose\n"
"the site for the seance!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"She likely found out about my\n"
"plans for the seance somehow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"You were quite vocal about the seance, Kiyo.\n"
"You even had instructions for it in your lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"Our culprit, Himiko, prepared her seesaw trap\n"
"ahead of time..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Then she waited for me to host the seance, \n"
"and suggested the <CLT=cltSTRONG>middle room<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"She led us all into holding the\n"
"seance right where she wanted it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Then, she killed Tenko.\n"
"All according to plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Th-That's a lie, right?\n"
"Himiko...did such a thing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"In the end, Himiko, who Tenko cherished \n"
"and loved, tragically killed her..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "W-Wait! We don't know that, right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"He's wrong. Right, Himiko!?\n"
"Himiko would never kill Tenko! Right!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "Kill...Tenko...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "I...killed Tenko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Himiko...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "What's wrong, Himiko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It is true that using the middle room\n"
"was Himiko's idea..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>But does that mean that\n"
"Himiko really killed Tenko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...Would something like that\n"
"really happen...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Something so cruel..."
