msgctxt "0001"
msgid ""
"That's it! The reason the culprit stuck\n"
"the katana into the effigy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"...was so that it would hit the sliding\n"
"lock as the <CLT=cltSTRONG>effigy spun<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "Effigy...spun?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"That's right. If you spun the effigy, the\n"
"rope it was hanging from would twist."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Then, if you let it go, the rope would unwind,\n"
"and the effigy would spin the other way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "And of course, the katana would spin with it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"I see! So the culprit used the katana's\n"
"counterspin to push the lock into place!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"The culprit simply needed to spin\n"
"the effigy's rope and then swiftly leave..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"This would cause the spinning katana\n"
"to hit the sliding lock..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"And thus was the back door of an empty \n"
"classroom locked from the inside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Yes. That's how Angie's lab\n"
"was locked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "By using the effigy with the katana."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"A plan born from the heart of a sword, \n"
"traveling through the air to intercept us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Oh, but could it have moved the\n"
"slide lock so easily?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"The sliding lock was pretty loose.\n"
"A little push could move it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"As long as the spinning katana hit the\n"
"lock, it would have slid into position."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"Even if the culprit failed the first couple \n"
"times, they could keep trying until it locked."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Which is why the culprit chose to strike\n"
"at nighttime, as to avoid detection."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"Yes, since the student council prohibited\n"
"anyone from walking around at nighttime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Are you saying...it's the student council's\n"
"fault?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "I didn't say that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"In any case, the culprit probably used\n"
"the murder weapon for this trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"It had to have been the right length\n"
"to hit the sliding lock from the effigy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"The culprit couldn't find a blade long enough\n"
"in my lab, so they settled for the katana."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"The other effigies were only hung up so \n"
"we'd think it was some kinda ceremony."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "That way, we wouldn't notice the lock trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"But...Kokichi did say earlier that he\n"
"could have picked the lock closed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"I don't want to completely ignore that\n"
"possibility..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"...but I can't imagine the culprit would\n"
"have done all this just for a distraction."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"If that's the case, then Kokichi's confession\n"
"earlier was actually..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Seriously!? You fuckin' lied again!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid "Cough it up, Kokichi!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Aw maaaan, you guys got me...\n"
"Okaaay, I'm not the culprit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "You're telling the truth this time, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "I wanna say I'm lying, but I'm not."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "Why did you say you were the culprit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "...I wanted to lure the culprit out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"If I claimed to be the culprit, then the *real*\n"
"culprit would agree as well, ya get me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"And if they pressured me to confess, then that\n"
"would've looked mighty suspicious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Sheesh! Darn it! It didn't go my way \n"
"because Shuichi butted in on my plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Tch! You and your fuckin' lies! Go sit\n"
"in the corner and play with yourself!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "O-kay! I'll start right now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Alright! So, who's the asshole who set up\n"
"this locked-room mystery!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "Miu...I can't hold it up anymore..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"What's the matter!?\n"
"You goin' soft on me now!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Who made the locked-room mystery doesn't \n"
"matter, since anyone could've done it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Don't you even understand something as\n"
"basic as that, you filthy cum dumpster?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "C-Cum dumpster...!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Finally...! Someone...finally called me\n"
"a cum dumpster!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Wh-What should we talk about now...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"We must focus not on the locked\n"
"room, but on who entered Angie's lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Only one of the student council members—\n"
"or Kokichi—could have gained entry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Therefore, the culprit must\n"
"be among their number."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"That leaves us with four suspects...\n"
"Tsumugi, Gonta, Keebo...and Kokichi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"Don't forget Himiko.\n"
"She's also a part of the student council."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Doesn't matter if she was besties with \n"
"Angie, she's still a suspect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"That contradicts what you said earlier, which\n"
"I can prove using my recording function..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "...It's fine. That's just a waste of time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "Me? A suspect?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid "I'd...never kill Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"So calling all suspects, what should we\n"
"discuss next?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"I wanna hear everyone's opinion. What would\n"
"you say to get yourself off the suspect list?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Why are you trying to lead the debate?\n"
"You're a suspect, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Silence, outsider! Only the Suspect Rangers\n"
"are allowed to speak!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid "S-Suspect Rangers!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"I agree. Those under suspicion\n"
"should explain themselves thoroughly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "We might catch 'em with their pants down!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Anywaaaay, I wanna ask the \n"
"Suspect Rangers..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"What should we talk about!? What should we\n"
"say to get ourselves off the suspect list!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Well, guys!? I wanna hear what you think!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"U-Umm... That's sort of a difficult\n"
"question, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Gonta not smart enough to know\n"
"answer to that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Y-Yes... It is difficult to formulate a logical\n"
"response to that question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Not articulate with words, huh?\n"
"Don't you guys wanna prove your innocence?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"They don't trust you one bit and I don't\n"
"blame 'em. You're probably plotting—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Why...did Tenko have to die?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"I wanna know what happened \n"
"to Angie, too, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Can we talk about Tenko's case\n"
"now and not just Angie's—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"

"Mwah-hahahaha!\n"
"I got ya exactly where I wanted, Himiko!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "Nyeh? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"The two victims could've been killed by two\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"So we need to find the first blackened\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid "We gotta figure out who killed Angie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Until we solve Angie's case, Tenko's case\n"
"is meaningless!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid "Did you suggest that to waste our ti—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "It's not meaningless!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid "Tenko's death was meaningless? How dare you!"

msgid "Lies...?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"You didn't give two shits about Tenko when\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"But now you're like, \"Oh, no! Poor Tenko!\"\n"
"after she's dead. C'mon, really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Kokichi! Enough!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"No...it's okay.\n"

msgctxt "0102"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"Yeah, seriously!\n"

msgctxt "0114"

msgctxt "0119"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"No, even if it was a different culprit, we \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"Don't listen to his crap. We haven't decided\n"

msgctxt "0129"
