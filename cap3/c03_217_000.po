msgctxt "0056"

msgctxt "0057"

msgctxt "0058"
msgid "S-Suicide!?"

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"If she committed suicide, it would explain\n"

msgctxt "0060"

"She volunteered to be in the cage, and then\n"
"stabbed herself during the seance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid "It wouldn't matter how dark the room was."

msgctxt "0062"

"But the sickle she was stabbed with\n"

msgctxt "0063"

"If Tenko had stabbed herself, wouldn't the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Perhaps that explains why the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"After stabbing herself with the sickle,\n"
"she threw it underneath the floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"So she took off the floorboard to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid "There's no reason for Tenko to commit suicide!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"Maybe I wasn't too far off with the theory\n"
"I had earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Y'know, about Tenko killing Angie?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "Nyeh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Because Tenko and Angie were fighting for\n"
"your attention, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid "Hey, Angie! When did you brainwash Himiko!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Tenko's pent-up frustration led her to\n"
"commit such an atrocity..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Her conscience couldn't handle it anymore, \n"
"so she decided to end her own life."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Wh-What...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"But...if she was gonna kill herself,\n"
"why do it during the seance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "She wanted to hide the truth of her suicide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid "R-Really? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"There could only be one reason to hide it \n"
"in a killing game, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "It's to <CLT=cltSTRONG>take us down with her<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "Take us down...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"She wanted us to pick the wrong\n"
"answer during the class trial..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"...so she could bring us all down!\n"
"She wanted us to die with her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Okay, well, she probably just wanted Himiko\n"
"to die with her. But still..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Wh-What are you saying?\n"
"Tenko...wasn't like that."
msgstr ""

"Keep your chin up and live life facing forward!\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "A lie...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "Wait! We should believe Tenko's last words!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"The true terror of class trials is that \n"
"you shouldn't believe everything said."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"Himiko, you said that Tenko would never\n"
"do anything like that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"But how can you be so sure?\n"
"Did you guys *actually* know each other?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"People keep all sorts of secrets, like Maki. She\n"
"hid the fact that she's a cold-blooded killer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"Is it wise of us to trust other people\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Geez...you're such a naive dude."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "...Naive?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"We're all just people, y'know? Of course\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"

"What matters is whether there's any malice\n"

msgctxt "0103"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"That's why it all comes down to whether \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid ""
"If you get betrayed, it's not their fault!\n"
"It's your fault for believing in them!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"That's why I believed in Maki Roll!\n"
"Because I wanted to believe in her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"Just because you're acting all cool\n"
"doesn't mean you get to skip training."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"

msgctxt "0111"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"Me too. Gonta no can believe Tenko commit\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "Alright...I'll give you a reason."

msgctxt "0122"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid "Yes, there is. Will you trust me, Maki?"
