"I made them! Don't they look lifelike?\n"
"Aren't they just divine?"

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "You made them...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Yep, they're my very own handcrafted wax\n"
"effigies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid "Wax effigies? Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Why? For the resurrection ritual, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Umm, according to the <CLT=cltSTRONG>Necronomicon<CLT=cltNORMAL>, we need\n"
"an effigy of the deceased to perform the <CLT=cltSTRONG>ritual<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "So I went ahead and made these."

"Simple dolls probably would've been better, but\n"

"Nyahaha! And before I knew it, I had made these!\n"
"What do you think? Aren't they amazing?"

msgctxt "0011"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid "Hm? What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"It's incredible...\n"
"For a second, I thought they were real."

msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Yeah...just like the real thing.\n"
"But..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"

msgctxt "0017"

"<CLT=cltMIND>But I know Maki isn't very good at\n"
"persuading people. So it's up to me."

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"The fact that Angie can do things like this\n"
"without a care is what makes her so dangerous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "Please! You have to stop Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid "Angie...could you please reconsider?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid "...I see, I see. Reconsider what, exactly?"

"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>ritual<CLT=cltNORMAL> that you're\n"

msgctxt "0023"

"bad that might be."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Remember that this was Monokuma's <CLT=cltSTRONG>motive<CLT=cltNORMAL>.\n"
"If he *wants* us to do it, it can't be good."

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"But the dead can't really come back to life.\n"
"So the people who died must still be alive—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "No, Angie. That's not possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"The bodies were not fakes. I'm positive.\n"
"Especially after seeing the wax effigies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"The effigies were nearly perfect, but the real\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Ryoma, Kirumi, Rantaro...and Kaede...are dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"...I agree. I have no doubts that their\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"Trust me, I've seen my fair share of dead\n"
"bodies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"I see, I see... If that's what Maki says then\n"
"maybe they really are dead."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Then...if we do the ritual, will we actually\n"
"resurrect the dead?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "What a miraculous mystery."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"...What are you saying? Someone who has\n"
"died can't be resurrected."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "Hm? But that's not what Atua says."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"He says that if we do the ritual, everyone who\n"
"has died up till now will come back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"So...if those four really are dead, then the\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>resurrection ritual<CLT=cltNORMAL> will surely work."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Nyahahaha! That must be right!\n"
"Cuz Atua is never wrong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid "You're...not gonna stop this, are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Of course not! This is Atua's will!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid "This is your will, not Atua's."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Nuh-uh, it's Atua's."

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Atua told me that our friends will come back\n"
"to life if we do this ritual."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"So we have to do it. We can't defy a direct\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Is that so? Then there's no point\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Hmm, are we done talking now? Cuz I'm\n"
