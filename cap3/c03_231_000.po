"That's it! The <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic circle<CLT=cltNORMAL>!\n"
"They used the magic circle!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"Remember? The magic circle was\n"
"drawn with <CLT=cltSTRONG>salt<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"The culprit used the salt's texture\n"
"to feel their way through the dark."

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"I see... So Kiyo traced the magic circle with\n"
"his hands to get to the loose floorboard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Ooh, I see. You drew the magic circle\n"
"with salt to use it as a guide."

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... An interesting thought.\n"
"It is unfortunate that it is so wrong."

msgctxt "0008"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Recall the document.\n"
"What did the magic circle look like?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"Based on the document, the magic circle\n"
"wouldn't reach the corners of the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid "So what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"When the room was darkened, each of \n"
"us was in a corner of the room, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"The magic circle didn't reach us,\n"
"so I could not have followed it, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"But you're talking about the\n"
"magic circle in the document!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"That doesn't mean the circle you\n"
"drew was the same!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"No, I most definitely drew it exactly\n"
"the same. I have it perfectly memorized."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"U-Um...so which is it?\n"
"Is there any way to check?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Not anymore. The magic circle is a complete\n"
"mess from being trampled on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I see... Another\n"
"piece of the puzzle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Drawing the circle with salt all but\n"
"guaranteed it would be temporary."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The investigation itself would have\n"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Hmm...what a pain.\n"

msgctxt "0024"

"E-Excuse me, everyone. May I have your\n"
"attention please!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Welp, I guess there's no point in discussing\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0028"

msgctxt "0029"
msgid "About what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"I had Miu add another function to my body,\n"

msgid ""
"What the...!? No way...\n"
"Did you really...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"S-Stop! You can't! I didn't install it\n"

msgctxt "0033"

"Please, let me use it! With it, I might\n"

msgctxt "0034"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "...It's an <CLT=cltSTRONG>image recording function<CLT=cltNORMAL>."

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Huh? Image recording!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "...I'll give it a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "...Ready?"

msgctxt "0040"
msgid "<CLT=cltSYSTEM>*whirrrrrr*"

msgctxt "0041"

msgid ""
"Ah, hm. I think something\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"Hm? As far as I can tell, it looks the same\n"
"as the drawing in the document."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"Since we're trying to find out how the culprit\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"

"Is there really a point in paying attention to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"

msgctxt "0070"

"You just said that you drew the magic circle\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "But that's a lie, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"The magic circle at the scene had\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>lines that stretched to the room's corners<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Which means that you would be able to find\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"So it was different from the document\n"
"after all!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"All because Himiko noticed!\n"
"And...because of Keebo, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"Hey, where's my thanks!? I'm the one\n"
"who installed that function into Keebo!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Hey, yeah. What was it you were\n"
"saying about its purpose?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"O-Oh... To be honest, the purpose of that image\n"
"recording function is to monitor my health..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Specifically, I make Keebo use that function\n"
"every day to...*sigh*... analyze my turds..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "Your what!? Why!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Sh-Shit is a great indicator of intestinal\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Quit talking about your poop!\n"
"No one cares!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"Kiyo...you killed Tenko, didn't you?\n"

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "So, Kiyo, if you have any objections, you can—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Well, since you've given me the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"To be honest, it's unimportant.\n"
