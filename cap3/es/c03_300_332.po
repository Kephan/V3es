msgctxt "0057"

"She was always in and out of the \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"

msgctxt "0080"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"E-Either way, he's totally outta his mind.\n"

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"You said you killed a lot already, right? \n"
"So it wasn't just the two you killed here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid "Wh-What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... Seems like he was already\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"You didn't kill to escape from hereâ€”\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Do not make me out to be some\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"I see... So when we were deciding\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"Before that, let's choose a spiritual\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid "You said it would work best with a girl."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"I spent my time evaluating\n"
"all the girls here..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"And besides Maki and Miu,\n"
"they were all worthy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid "All worthy of being Sister's friends!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "All...worthy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Hey, how come I'm not included!?\n"
"I mean, not like I care!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"Then...the second vicitim...\n"
"could've been me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid "Tenko...died in place of me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "Then I'll do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"I can't think of anyone but me\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "...No, I'll do it."

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"Himiko would've been great, but\n"
"Tenko volunteering made me so happy..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"Her noble, earnest heart made\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "Huh? Infiltrate? Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid "But...how did you...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... It was obvious to me.\n"
"I have studied many people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"Yes! She stood up against the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "All for her beloved friend!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"I was so touched by that! Wonderful!\n"
"She was a perfect friend for Sister!"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"Though...I was planning on having you \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid "Wh-What...? You do all that forâ€”"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid ""
"Wooow, you did all that just to kill. For you\n"
"to go that far...that's pretty impressive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"You were interested in <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\n"
"just so you could use it to kill someone, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"It interested me as an anthropologist,\n"
"of course. But more than that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"I wanted to kill for Sister!\n"
"I cannot deny that overpowering feeling!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0121"
msgid ""
"Kaito, are you okay?\n"
"You look...kinda pale..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"D-Don't worry about it... \n"
"Let's focus on Kiyo right now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"Allow me to explain, though.\n"
"I did not plan to kill both of them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""
"I knew I would have plenty of\n"
"chances after escaping this place."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"But Angie walked in on me preparing and \n"
"I ended up killing her a different way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid ""
"So I figured I may as well kill\n"
"someone else, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""
"After all, it would be a shame to just\n"
"waste the seance trick I prepared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"Y-You're talking like...you killed her\n"
"just because you could..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid ""
"No, not just because I could...\n"
"I was sending another friend to Sister."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid ""
"Korekiyo, you're such a thoughtful little\n"
"brother. But it was bad to get greedy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid ""
"You're right... Because of that, now I\n"
"can't send 100 friends to Sister."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"Do you understand now? Those were the\n"
"circumstances of Korekiyo's crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"I...I do not understand. This is all too\n"
"impossible for me to understand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"Th-That right... Killing two friends for your\n"
"dead sister!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid "That...wrong! That so wrong!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "Kehehe... Oh, don't get so worked up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"There's something I learned after\n"
"Sister's death..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"Death only changes a person's form.\n"
"The soul lives on as a ghost."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid "C-Cut it out already!"

msgctxt "0142"
msgid ""
"I don't understand anything you're saying.\n"
"Nothing's making sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid ""
"It's not fair! Why did Angie and Tenko \n"
"have to die for something so unfair!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid "Because <CLT=cltSTRONG>death<CLT=cltNORMAL> is unfair."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid "Nyeh!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "All deaths are <CLT=cltSTRONG>unfair deaths<CLT=cltNORMAL>."

msgctxt "0147"
msgid ""
"Why do you think news stations get such high\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid "Because...everyone likes unfair deaths."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid ""
"Well if you look at it like that, this whole\n"

msgctxt "0150"

msgctxt "0167"

msgctxt "0168"
