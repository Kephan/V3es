"Nyeh!? Why was blood from Angie\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "Yeah, wasn't Angie killed in her research lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Just because we found her body there, \n"

msgctxt "0078"

"We assumed that only council members could've \n"

"But if she died somewhere else, then we can't\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"

"So the culprit didn't enter her lab, but\n"

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"I'm not sure if the culprit waited for her, but\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Well, I thought that was more likely from\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"

"So I went to <CLT=cltSTRONG>places Angie might've gone<CLT=cltNORMAL>,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"Places she might've gone? Why did you\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"Hm? The empty rooms were the only places\n"
"I could think of that Angie would go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... It seems Kokichi's up to\n"

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... I do lie a lot,\n"
