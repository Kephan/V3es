"That's it! Angie went to that room\n"
"to get a candle!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "Yeah! For kinky waxplay!"

msgctxt "0003"

"Uh, no... Angie was gonna use it\n"

"Then, did she seek out a candle so she\n"
"could burn the book?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"That's right! There's nothing to start a fire\n"
"with in Angie's lab..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"So she went to go get a candle from\n"
"one of the empty rooms!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "And that's when the culprit attacked her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"That's why there was dried blood under\n"
"floor..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Which means, Angie was attacked in\n"
"the same room the seance was held!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"Bravo, Himiko! Well done for choosing \n"
"that room for the seance!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid "Nyeh...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"If we hadn't done the seance in that room, then\n"
"Tenko's murder would've been in another room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"If that happened, no one would've discovered\n"
"Angie's bloodstain under the floorboards."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"That's right. Shuichi and I only checked under\n"
"the floorboards where Tenko died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"Yup, it's all thanks to Himiko for choosing \n"
"the same room as Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"This must be Atua's will!\n"
"Or maybe the power of magic?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"It's neither...\n"
"I just picked one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Hold on... You're all acting as though\n"
"you've proven that as fact already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"You claim Angie was murdered in the\n"
"empty room and then moved to the lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"Then how do you explain the large\n"
"amount of blood in the lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"It may be possible to carry a body,\n"
"but blood cannot be moved."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"I think she was still alive after\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid "Hm...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"She was killed after she was\n"
"carried to her lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>That means the culprit attacked her twice.\n"
"I have evidence of that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"There was blood on the katana, correct?\n"
"So Angie was killed in the lab—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"So you understand, yes? Angie's murder\n"
"happened entirely in the lab..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"That's why I couldn't have done it.\n"
"Don't accuse me with your shoddy logic."

"Hm, that reminds me... Wasn't there something\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"What relevance does that have? None. \n"
"There is no evidence to prove it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Is there really no evidence though?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"If she didn't die in the empty room,\n"
"then why was she attacked twice?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""

"What is the proof Angie was still\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"The fatal wound was a cut to the back\n"
"of her neck from a katana."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"But she also showed signs of <CLT=cltSTRONG>blunt\n"
"force trauma<CLT=cltNORMAL>, and I think I know why."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"After Angie was knocked unconscious in the\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"I see! So that puddle of blood\n"
"is from the killing blow!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid "Hah! It's all clear now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Angie was attacked in the empty room, \n"
