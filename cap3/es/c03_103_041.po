msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"Then the culprit could've gone from room to room\n"

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"True, but it would have been difficult\n"

msgctxt "0039"
msgid ""
"We did alright because we had a light.\n"

"If she was attacked with this, she wouldn't\n"

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"The blade could fit through the gaps in\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"The cage is three feet high... If you were to\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Well, it would depend on Tenko's posture...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Then her posture is the question..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Hey... If the weapon is down here, the culprit\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Perhaps after killing Tenko, the culprit threw\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The blade might fit through the gaps in\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The cage is about three feet tall, so\n"
"sticking a six-inch blade in that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It would all depend on her body position\n"

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>In addition to all that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If we assume the weapon is down here\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Then either the culprit threw the sickle\n"

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""

msgid ""
"Ah, look! Part of the crosspiece that supports\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"It's near the loose floorboard, and the portion\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid "And from what I can see of it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid ""
"It wasn't broken off naturally.\n"
"This was cut by someone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"There should be saws in the warehouse,\n"
"so they could have used that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "The question is, why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Another crosspiece is supporting the floorboard,\n"
"so it might not fall if this portion is missing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "So what purpose did this serve?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The floorboard underneath Tenko's body is loose,\n"

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
