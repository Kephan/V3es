"Miu, you gave Keebo his\n"
"flashlight function, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid "...Did you not notice?"

msgctxt "0003"
msgid "I didn't notice what?"

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It's hard to believe that Keebo\n"

msgctxt "0005"

"<CLT=cltMIND>It's even harder to believe that this\n"
"trial isn't being manipulated by someone..."

msgctxt "0006"

"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>drawback<CLT=cltNORMAL> of the flashlight\n"

msgctxt "0008"

"It's <CLT=cltSTRONG>so bright, even Keebo can't see<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"when it's turned on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Hmmm, I see...\n"
"That bright, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"...Wait, what!? There's no way a genius like me\n"
"would make that kinda rookie mistake!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"But...you make mistakes a lot...\n"
"A whole lot..."

msgid ""
"Hey! If you're gonna fuck me in front of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"If he can't see, it doesn't matter how\n"
"bright the area is. He couldn't move like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"So Keebo couldn't have been\n"
"underneath the floor!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid ""
"I-Is that true, Keebo? \n"
"Is what Shuichi said true?"

msgctxt "0018"

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"I'm so sorry! I just don't remember!\n"
"Really, I'm sorry!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Aagh! We get it already! \n"
"Just turn it off! We're gonna go blind!"

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"You don't remember?\n"
"What does that even mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Well, Shuichi...\n"
"Tryin' to make a fool outta me, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid ""
"Lemme put on some makeup, cuz I wanna at least\n"
"look pretty before you decide to fuck me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid "Shuichi, I'm so sorry!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid "Damn! That is seriously bright!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"Wouldn't the light have shined through the <CLT=cltSTRONG>gaps\n"
"of the floorboard<CLT=cltNORMAL> if it had been this bright?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>The hole..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"Yes...the culprit couldn't have used a\n"
"light under the floor. Not even Keebo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid "Oh? They coudn't have...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"We were there, after all.\n"
"We would know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"There was a hole near the corner\n"
"of the room we were in, remember?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"If someone had a light under the floor,\n"
"it would have leaked through."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"But...when we did the seance, I'm pretty sure\n"
"the room was pitch black."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"That's right. We didn't see anything,\n"
"so the culprit couldn't have used a light."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"And just because I have a built-in flashlight\n"
"function, does not mean I am the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "I see... That was a flaw in my theory."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"I don't think the culprit could have\n"
"used a light while under the floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"There was a hole in\n"
"the corner of the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"If a light were used, it would have leaked\n"
"through and we would have seen it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"But...when we did the seance, the room was\n"
"definitely pitch black."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"So a light was not shined under the floor, which\n"
"means you cannot claim I am the culprit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Geez, here I thought this would be the case \n"
"where the murder could only be done by a robot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"You have accused me of being the culprit—more\n"
"than once now—simply because I am a robot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"My status as a robot does not mean I am\n"
"capable of performing superhuman feats!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"My vision is somewhat poor, and I only possess\n"
"average physical strength and intelligence!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"Alright, alright, you made your point.\n"
"God, now I feel sorta bad for you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid "I neither want nor need your pity!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"Enough with the flashlight!\n"
"It's way too bright!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"It would've been difficult to move around\n"
"under the floor in that pitch-black darkness."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"Maybe the floor and the hole have nothing\n"
"to do with this case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"Then why was floorboard under Tenko\n"
"lined up funny?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"Gonta think that was so culprit could\n"
"stab Tenko from under floor..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"Ooohh! Nice observation, Gonta! Are you finally\n"
"getting used to the class trials?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid "Uh-huh. Thank you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"Don't say it like that... You're better \n"
"off not being used to this kinda stuff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"Maybe they marked Tenko with glowing paint\n"
"and looked for that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid ""
"That'd let the culprit find her. Then they\n"
"could stab her through the floorboards..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Boy, that sounds really familiar too!\n"
"But I'm just gonna ignore it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Her corpse didn't have any trace of glowing\n"
"paint though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Oh...yeah. So then why was that\n"
"floorboard loose?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"The loose floorboard was the one\n"
"under Tenko, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"If the culprit used it while she was\n"
"still alive, she'd totally notice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"Who fuckin' cares? Fussin' over that\n"
"won't get us closer to the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"We shouldn't dismiss this line of\n"
"inquiry, however..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Instead of butting our heads against this, \n"
"how about we concentrate on another issue?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "What other issue?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"Perhaps first, we should figure out\n"
"how and when exactly Tenko was killed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "When...? So not during seance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid ""
"Tenko was in the metal cage for the\n"
"whole seance, wasn't she?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "How could someone have gotten to her there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Maybe the culprit killed her before she\n"
"went under the metal cage?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"That's not possible...\n"
"She was alive at that point."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"This is the point of no return, Tenko.\n"
"After this point, you mustn't speak."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"The next time you open your mouth,\n"
"it will be Angie speaking through you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Understood. I will not say a word until\n"
"the seance is over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Yes. She was unmistakably alive\n"
"when the seance began..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"That was right before we blew out the\n"
"candles. But when the light came back..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"The floorboard was removed at that point,\n"
"so it's likely she was already dead then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid "So she was killed when the room was dark?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"But she was inside cage, right? \n"
"Gonta think it unpossible to kill her then!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"Then she wasn't killed when the room\n"
"was dark! It was a different time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085"
msgid "A...different time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"How the fuck should I know!?\n"
"You figure it out, shitheads!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"Since Gonta said it was impossible, I'm\n"
"proposing an alternate theory."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid "Now hurry up and think!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"If you wanna make my golden brain tingle,\n"
"start circlejerkin' your limpdick brains!"
msgstr ""
