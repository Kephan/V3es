msgctxt "0008"

msgctxt "0020"

msgctxt "0021"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"

"So does that mean we can't get the key?\n"
"What the hell...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"By the way, those guys said they know\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"That's probably why this lab fits Angie's\n"
"tastes so well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"So does that mean...this school was specially\n"
"made for us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Monokuma has claimed that before...\n"
"but is that really possible?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"

"This giant complex was built just \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "I wonder..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"Is it supposed to be like this? Or did they\n"
"just not finish it in time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"Those cheap knock-offs are useless.\n"
"Like that time they mixed up the Kubs Pads."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"I don't care. This kinda bare ceiling doesn't\n"
"bother me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Even Atua says it's more sensitive when\n"
"the skin's peeled back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I don't care either. If it makes life here\n"

msgctxt "0080"

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Sculpting tools, chisels, and a wooden hammer!\n"
"What a divine collection of tools!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"Now that you mention it...\n"
"I don't see any completed pieces in here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084"
msgid ""
"I would expect an art room to have sculptures\n"

"<CLT=cltMIND>What is this heap of stuff?\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "Ohhh, this is wax for making wax sculptures."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Ah, wax sculptures, huh?\n"
"You can make those, Angie?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"Unlike wood or stone, wax has a soft texture\n"
"for sculpting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Oh, but Atua is the one who's gonna be doing\n"
"the sculpting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "Ah, I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"But, but it seems like people have been\n"

"In ancient times, death masks used to be\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid ""

"on here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid "Ah, right, and the door that we used..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid ""
"Yeah, that door has a knob and\n"
"a cylinder lock."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"The same classroom has two different kinds\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid "No, no. It's perfect that they're not the same."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Symmetry is a western beauty ideal. They like\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"But I think asymmetry and partition functions\n"
