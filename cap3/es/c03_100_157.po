msgid ""
"2 a.m. Everyone must have been asleep...\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087"
msgid ""
"So...the murder happened at nighttime\n"
"after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid ""
"If everyone had followed the student council's\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid "A member of the student council? Th-That's—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"We should go and figure that out! Let's start\n"

msgstr "..."

msgctxt "0093"
msgid "I can't..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid "H-Himiko...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"I can't...do it...\n"
"I can't investigate Angie's body..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid ""
"But...if we don't make it through the class trial,\n"
"then everyone will die..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid "I...don't care anymore..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"Surviving...and everything else...\n"
"It's too much of a pain..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid ""
"Then why don't we just use your magic\n"
"to revive Angie!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"This is no time for your mean-spirited taunts!\n"
"Reviving her is clearly impossible!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid "We cannot say that with certainty, no?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid "Excuse me!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"
msgid ""
"Well...of course resurrecting her is impossible,\n"
"but I know a way we can speak with Angie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105"
msgid ""
"We can summon her spirit with \n"
"a seance called <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Seance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Y-Yeah! This is no time for jokes!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"Oh, I'm serious...\n"
"This is for our investigation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "For our investigation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"If we speak with Angie, we can ask her who the\n"
"culprit is and bring this case to a swift close."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"First, a <CLT=cltSTRONG>resurrection ritual<CLT=cltNORMAL> and now a <CLT=cltSTRONG>seance<CLT=cltNORMAL>?\n"
"Are you messing with us?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... I would appreciate it if you didn't\n"
"compare it to Monokuma's foolishness..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid ""
"Seances are genuine occurrences. They are \n"
"written of in literature the world over."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"In fact, I myself have participated in\n"
"seances a great many times..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "M-Many times?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid ""
"On top of that, we have here a rare chance to \n"
"perform the legendary seance, <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid ""
"It would be foolish to not take advantage\n"
"of this, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"N-No matter how you put it, now's not \n"
"the time for something—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"Oh? I suspect the only way to confirm your \n"
"earlier theory is by performing the seance, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "My...earlier theory?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid ""
"The possibility of the culprit being \n"
"the resurrected <CLT=cltSTRONG>transfer student<CLT=cltNORMAL>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"It is not wise to go into the class trial with\n"
"such outlandish theories in one's head."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""
"So to prove such a thing impossible,\n"
"I think it best we consult Angie herself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid "Th-That logic is peculiar, to say the least!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid ""
"Holding a seance to find out about the <CLT=cltSTRONG>ritual<CLT=cltNORMAL>...\n"
"So we're gonna fight the occult with the occult."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid ""
"Well, we can't worry about this forever, so we\n"
"might as well go with the easiest solution."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid ""
"Okay, I'll help out! I was getting bored\n"
"of investigating, anyway!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0130"
msgid "I'll help too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid "Huh!? You too, Himiko!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid ""
"If I can talk to Angie one more time...\n"
"I'll do anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"A seance or whatever it takes...\n"
"I'll do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid ""
"I-I'll help out as well!\n"
"I can't leave Himiko alone!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid "Do whatever you want..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "Okay...I will."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"So now we have four participants.\n"
"Kokichi, Himiko, Tenko, and myself..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid ""
"However, <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL> requires \n"
"five people. We're still one short..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid "Fiiiine, then Kee-boy can come, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0140"
msgid "I guess we can't be picky..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0141"
msgid ""
"Why am I being forced to participate AND\n"
"being treated like a burden!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0142"
msgid ""
"So then, we need a place to perform \n"
"the seance... Where shall we do it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0143"
msgid "How about your lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0144"
msgid ""
"No...in order for <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL> to succeed, \n"
"the room must be as dark as possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0145"
msgid ""
"My lab has windows, so turning the lights \n"
"off won't make it quite dark enough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0146"
msgid "Then...how about the empty rooms?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0147"
msgid "Empty rooms? The ones on the 4th floor?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0148"
msgid ""
"There aren't any windows there, so if we\n"
"blow out the candles, it should be pitch dark."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0149"
msgid "Sure, I'm fine with that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0150"
msgid "I agree with Himiko!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0151"
msgid ""
"However...there are three empty rooms.\n"
"Which one shall we use?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0152"
msgid ""
"Um...the middle room. The middle \n"
"room's always best for stuff like this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0153"
msgid ""
"Very well. I shall begin the preparations \n"
"at once."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0154"
msgid ""
"I shall have you four help as well. Let us carry\n"
"all the necessary equipment from my lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0155"
msgid "A-Are you really going to do this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0156"
msgid ""
"This is for our investigation.\n"
"I said as much, did I not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0157"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... We need to use all our effort to\n"
"discover the culprit, lest our lives be lost."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0158"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Kiyo, Kokichi, Keebo, Tenko, and\n"
"Himiko all left the scene."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0159"
msgid "Are they serious about this stupid seance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0160"
msgid ""
"Perhaps that's just part of the investigation\n"
"in their eyes... We should go with it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0161"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0163"

"Unpossible, even."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0164"
msgid "Why do you think that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0165"
msgid ""
"Cuz student council made rule that we no\n"

msgctxt "0166"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0167"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0168"
msgid ""
"But it Atua's rule. Angie say he punish us\n"
"if we not follow his rules..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0169"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0171"
msgid "Huh!? She was!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0172"
msgid ""
"N-No way. Student council would never\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0173"
msgid ""
"They shoulda been asleep in own rooms!\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0174"
