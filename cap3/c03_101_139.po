"First, we should confirm whether the katana\n"

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Earlier, the katana was inside\n"

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Maki, the gold leaf katana definitely came\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Doesn't that make Kiyo suspicious?\n"
"This is his research lab, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"Not necessarily. Anyone could have\n"

msgctxt "0023"

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... You look so disgusted right now.\n"
"Then again, I guess that is your signature look."

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Anyway, I forgot to bring something we need\n"

msgctxt "0029"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid "Yep, that white sheet over there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"We brought the wooden dog statue and the cage\n"

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"I don't get it... Why do you guys need a cage,\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"Hey, don't ask me! I don't know why\n"
"we need that stuff, either!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"That's why I figured I'd do a little research\n"
"on this seance before I got the sheet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid "...Study?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid "Soooo, let's see..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>Kokichi took a look around and..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid "I heard it was, like, some old handmade book..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Oh, is this it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Yep, it says <CLT=cltSTRONG>Caged Dog Village<CLT=cltNORMAL> right here\n"
"on the cover, so this must be it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Let's see... What does it say about <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged\n"
"Child<CLT=cltNORMAL> seance...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Kokichi flipped through the old book\n"
"he picked up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Oh, is it this page? It's hard to read, but I\n"
"can see <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL> is mentioned here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Yeah, Kiyo's drawing the same magic circle\n"
"as the one in this picture..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Okay, let's see...\n"
"In order to perform <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL>..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"...you need five people, including the spirit\n"
"medium, and a dark place with no light."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid "Just like Kiyo said..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"First, draw the magic circle, passed down from\n"
"the <CLT=cltSTRONG>Caged Dog Village<CLT=cltNORMAL>, on the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"In the center of the circle, the spirit medium\n"
"must kneel, curl like a turtle..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"...and rest their forehead on a stone on the\n"
"ground. Afterward, the other four participants..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"...must put the iron cage over the spirit\n"
"medium, and cover it with a white sheet..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid ""
"And finally, the Dog God must be placed \n"
"on top of the cage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid ""
"Also, it says we can't step on the\n"
"magic circle during the preparations..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"The \"Dog God\"? Do you mean the\n"
"wooden dog statue?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"When preparations are complete, turn out all\n"
"the lights to create complete darkness..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"The seance will begin when the four participants\n"
"are each standing at a corner of the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057"
msgid ""
"The four participants, not including the spirit\n"
"medium, will sing <CLT=cltSTRONG>The Caged Child<CLT=cltNORMAL> song..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058"
msgid ""
"After the song, ask, \"Is <CLT=cltSTRONG>the caged child<CLT=cltNORMAL>...\" \n"
"then say the name of the spirit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059"
msgid ""
"The spirit medium will reply in the voice of\n"
"the summoned spirit...and that's all it says!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060"
msgid "That sounds...complicated."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061"
msgid ""
"Complicated plans have a better chance of\n"
"working out in the end, wouldn't you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062"
msgid ""
"Whether it works or not...Kiyo has been wanting\n"
"to conduct this seance for a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063"
msgid ""
"Since I was fortunate enough to obtain one of\n"
"those copies, I have already memorized it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... But I never thought I'd be able to lay\n"
"eyes on the real one... What a trick of fate."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065"
msgid ""
"Oh, yeah. He said he memorized every\n"
"word of it, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066"
msgid ""
"That's probably why he left the book here, cuz\n"
"he can conduct the seance without it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067"
msgid ""
"But is it even possible?\n"
"Contacting Angie's ghost...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068"
msgid ""
"Nee-heehee... If you're so curious, why\n"
"don't you join us, Shuichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"
msgid ""
"You should see how it plays out with your\n"
"own eyes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid ""
"There's still time, y'know. The seance hasn't\n"
"even started yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "Maybe it's better if you join them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073"
msgid "You think so...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid "Well, I'm not going. I don't believe in seances."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"But whether you believe or not, as a detective\n"
"you should be there to observe what happens."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>As a detective, huh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid "Yeah...I think you're right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078"
msgid "Nee-heehee... Now you're talking."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079"
msgid ""
"Well, I'll be waiting for you! Of the three\n"
