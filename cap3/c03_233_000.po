"The only person who could have set up the\n"
"sickle and retrieved it afterward is Kiyo."

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"That was done by <CLT=cltSTRONG>covering the\n"
"cage with the white cloth<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"

"You could have secretly placed the sickle\n"
"when you draped the cloth..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"...and retrieved it afterward when you\n"
"removed the cloth!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"Then, while everyone was distracted, you\n"
"discreetly dropped the sickle under the floor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid "Wonderful! That's exactly correct!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid "<CLT=cltMIND>...What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"It's correct...?\n"
"Then why don't you give up already!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... The trick I put so much work\n"
"into is just wasted effort now. Alas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid "So...it was you? You killed Tenko!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"Let me guess, you'll never forgive me.\n"
"Himiko, you must hate me so very much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"Maybe you'd feel better if I\n"
"was executed by Monokuma..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid ""
"But unfortunately for you, \n"
"that won't happen!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"Because if you vote for me, every spotless,\n"
"including myself, will die."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Kiyo?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... \n"
"You still don't understand?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"I killed Tenko. That is the truth.\n"
"But it is meaningless in this class trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid "Meaningless!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid "You mean Monokuma's <CLT=cltSTRONG>extra rule<CLT=cltNORMAL>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"Ah, that's right. What happens to your votes\n"
"if there are two blackened candidates?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"Well, I have an answer for that!\n"
"It's <CLT=cltSTRONG>first come, first served<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022"
msgid ""
"You see...I killed Tenko,\n"
"but not Angie..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023"
msgid ""
"For us, Tenko's death is \n"
"nothing but a trivial issue..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024"
msgid ""
"Because the blackened in this trial is\n"
"the <CLT=cltSTRONG>culprit who killed Angie<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025"
msgid "A...trivial issue?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026"
msgid ""
"No...that's gotta be a lie.\n"
"You probably killed Angie, too!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027"
msgid ""
"That is simply not possible. Recall \n"
"that I was unable to enter Angie's lab."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028"
msgid ""
"Oh... Only student council members and\n"
"Kokichi could enter research lab..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029"
msgid ""
"How could I have possibly killed Angie\n"
"when I couldn't even enter her lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030"
msgid ""
"We...can figure that out. No one else\n"
"could've done it besides you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031"
msgid ""
"If you're the one who killed Tenko,\n"
"you gotta be the one who killed Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032"
msgid ""
"I understand how you feel, Himiko. But maybe\n"
"we can discuss this rationally and calmly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033"
msgid ""
"There is a non-zero possibility that Kiyo\n"
"is telling the truth."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034"
msgid ""
"So you understand how she feels. I see...\n"
"Wait! Robots can understand human feelings!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035"
msgid ""
"O-Of course I understand!\n"
"I work...really hard to understand!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036"
msgid ""
"Hey... Why're you gettin' all\n"
"worked up, Keebo? Chill, dude."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037"
msgid ""
"That's enough! It's Voting Time!\n"
"I'm gonna vote for him!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Voting for me will only\n"
"help the one who murdered Angie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039"
msgid "Isn't...Kiyo culprit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040"
msgid ""
"Of course I'm not...\n"
"This case was an error on my part."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041"
msgid ""
"Monokuma added that rule after\n"
"both bodies were found, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042"
msgid ""
"How was I to know that the trial\n"
"would only be for Angie's killer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043"
msgid ""
"Had I known, I certainly wouldn't\n"
"have killed Tenko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044"
msgid ""
"Y-You're lying!\n"
"You killed Tenko and Angie!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045"
msgid ""
"Now hold on, jumping to conclusions here\n"
"is dangerous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046"
msgid ""
"Mm-hm, we should talk it out more. This case\n"
"might have juicy plot twists waiting to happen!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047"
msgid ""
"Nuts to that! Any way you look at this case,\n"
"Kiyo is obviously the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048"
msgid ""
"Yeah... There's sorta no other \n"
"way to look at it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049"
msgid ""
"No, it's too dangerous to vote before\n"
"we arrive at a logical decision!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050"
msgid ""
"Wowee! This argument is getting intense!\n"
"At times like this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051"
msgid ""
"The Ultimate Academy is proud to present\n"
"its very own <CLT=cltSTRONG>morphenomenal trial grounds<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052"
msgid "Yippee! I've been waiting for this!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053"
msgid "Why were *you* waiting for it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Kiyo confessed to killing Tenko,\n"
"but insists he didn't kill Angie."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>We won't forgive Kiyo for what he did...\n"
"but we can't vote until we know the facts."

msgctxt "0056"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I have to pin down the evidence\n"
"and convince everyone!"
