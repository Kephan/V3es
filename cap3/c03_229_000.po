msgid ""
"If the culprit set traps in all the rooms, then\n"

msgctxt "0068"

msgctxt "0069"
msgid ""
"Well, as a self-proclaimed expert\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071"
msgid "Ah... That is a good point."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072"
msgid "It must've been barrier magic!"

msgctxt "0073"
msgid ""
"Well...that's one possibility... But I\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Why did no one step on the floorboard\n"
"until it was used for the murder..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...Ah! That's it!\n"
"That must be the reason!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076"
msgid ""
"The culprit put the cage somewhere\n"
"that it wouldn't be touched by us!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077"
msgid ""
"Non, non. We carried that iron cage with\n"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080"
msgid ""
"Was the crosspiece supporting the\n"
"floorboard the whole time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081"
msgid ""
"Maybe the culprit removed the crosspiece\n"
"right before stomping on the floorboard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082"
msgid ""
"Hmmm, you think so? It would've been smarter\n"
"if they made sure no one stepped on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083"
msgid ""
"If the culprit adds more to the plan, \n"
"then it'll become easier to screw up."

msgctxt "0084"

"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"

msgctxt "0085"

"Umm... It's kind of hard to imagine\n"
"if you didn't participate in the seance..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086"
msgid ""
"You were part of the seance, right\n"
"Shuichi? Do you remember anything?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088"
msgid "That doesn't seem like it's related..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089"
msgid ""
"Shuichi, when you were preparing the \n"
"seance, was there a spot you didn't step?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090"
msgid ""
"That could've been where the \n"
"floorboard trap was hidden."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092"
msgid ""
"Why did no one step on the floorboard\n"
"until the culprit used it in the murder?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093"
msgid ""
"It's because of the <CLT=cltSTRONG>magic circle<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"at the scene of the crime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094"
msgid ""
"Also, it's dark in here, so be sure \n"
"to watch your step."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095"
msgid ""
"If the magic circle is broken,\n"
"not only will the seance fail..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096"
msgid "But it may also unleash a curse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097"
msgid ""
"Before we began the seance, we were\n"
"warned not to step on the circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098"
msgid ""
"The floorboard in question was within the\n"
"circle. That's why no one stepped on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099"
msgid ""
"So the magic circle's purpose was to keep\n"
"us away from the whole trick."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100"
msgid "That was part of the culprit's plans, too?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>That's right!\n"
"If that's the case, then the culprit..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>There's no doubt in my mind.\n"
"They're the one who killed Tenko."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Only one person had the\n"
"opportunity and the motive."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104"

"Himiko...\n"

"This is no time to mess around!"

"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107"
msgid ""
"I already know who the culprit is, but I wanna\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108"
msgid "Obviously...you know already, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110"
msgid "It can't be that person, can it, Shuichi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111"
msgid ""
"Think about the magic circle and its purpose.\n"
"Whoever drew it is suspicious, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Everyone's staring at me...\n"
"I screwed up, they think I'm a fraud...\n"
"<CLT=cltNORMAL>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113"
msgid "Who killed Tenko?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114"
msgid "Kiyo...was it you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115"
msgid ""
"Hmm? Whatever are you\n"
"talking about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116"
msgid "I'm talking about Tenko's murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117"
msgid "Huh? Kiyo?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118"
msgid "Why do you suspect me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119"
msgid ""
"Because you were the one who\n"
"drew the magic circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120"
msgid ""
"The circle kept us from discovering\n"
"the seesaw trick..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121"
msgid "But that's not all it was for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122"
msgid "In order to make the murder succeed..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123"
msgid ""
"...variables, like Tenko's position and the\n"
"placement of the cage, needed to be defined."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124"
msgid ""
"And those variables were defined by using\n"
"the magic circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125"
msgid ""
"In short, the circle itself was the most\n"
"important tool in this murder."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126"
msgid ""
"Knowing that, the person who drew\n"
"the magic circle has to be the culprit!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0127"
msgid "Well, Kiyo?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0128"
msgid "A-Answer already! Did you do it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129"
msgid "Kehe...kehehehe..."

msgctxt "0130"
msgid "Kehehehehehehehehe..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0131"
msgid "...What is so funny?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0132"
msgid "I was just thinking..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0133"
msgid ""
"So this is how each blackened must have felt.\n"
"What an intriguing experience this is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0134"
msgid "What? An intriguing experience?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0135"
msgid ""
"But if I am the culprit as you claim,\n"
"then I stomped on the floorboard, yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0136"
msgid "So...do tell."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0137"
msgid ""
"How could I have stomped on the\n"
"floorboard during that darkened seance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0138"
msgid "I see... That is problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0139"
msgid ""
"Kehehe... Unless that is made clear,\n"
