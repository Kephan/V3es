"The <CLT=cltSTRONG>gold leaf katana<CLT=cltNORMAL> that was\n"
"stabbed into Kaede's effigy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0002"
msgid ""
"The culprit used that to hit the knob\n"
"of the sliding lock to lock the door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0003"
msgid ""
"So the <CLT=cltSTRONG>gold leaf<CLT=cltNORMAL> was on the sliding lock\n"
"because..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004"
msgid ""
"Because when the katana hit the lock,\n"
"some of the gold leaf rubbed off on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005"
msgid ""
"The gold leaf on that katana\n"
"did peel rather easily."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006"
msgid ""
"Hmmm... That evidence rings a bell.\n"
"Specifically, a school bell..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007"
msgid ""
"Huh!? Are you talking about a different\n"
"school!? What school was it!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008"
msgid ""
"Now now, that doesn't matter anymore.\n"
"Let's not dwell on the past."

msgctxt "0009"
msgid ""
"Oooh, the gold leaf landed on the sliding \n"
"lock when the katana touched it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010"
msgid ""
"So that means, the culprit used the katana \n"
"to move the sliding lock, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011"
msgid ""
"But wait, how did they move it with a katana?\n"
"And from outside Angie's lab?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012"
msgid ""
"The clue that might give us the answer\n"
"is the <CLT=cltSTRONG>layout of the area<CLT=cltNORMAL> itself."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013"
msgid "It was an odd setup, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014"
msgid ""
"The katana stabbed into the effigy, the\n"
"effigies hung upside down..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015"
msgid "Angie didn't do that as part of the ritual?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016"
msgid ""
"No... Nowhere in the Necronomicon did\n"
"it say you had to hang the effigies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017"
msgid ""
"If it was not part of the ritual...then it must\n"
"have been for a different purpose, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>A different purpose...\n"
"What could that have been?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>The culprit somehow used\n"
"the setup to lock the room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>In that case, I need to know the reason\n"
"behind every step of that setup..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>If I do that, the way the culprit\n"
"locked the room should be clear!"
