msgctxt "0002 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"More importantly...let's continue the\n"

msgctxt "0003 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"We understand Miu plotted the murder,\n"
"but we need to find out <CLT=cltSTRONG>who killed her<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0004 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"And in order to figure that out, we need to\n"
"understand Miu's actions..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0005 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"So, let's discuss her murder scheme\n"
"step-by-step!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0006 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"I know that's important, but hearing you \n"
"lead the conversation really pisses me off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0007 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Let's see, Miu manipulated the Virtual World\n"
"to use it as part of her murder plan..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0008 | C001_Momot"
msgid "Don't just ignore me and start anyway..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0009 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"If she had succeeded, she would've gone past\n"
"the wall between the chapel and mansion..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0010 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"and then—WHAM!—murdered me on the\n"
"roof with the hammer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0011 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"She would make the murder seem like it happened\n"
"in the real world, and then pin it on Kaito."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0012 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"As for Miu's alibi in the real world, she could\n"
"say she was logged into the Virtual World..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0013 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"And in the Virtual World, she could say\n"
"she was near the chapel the entire time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0014 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"She'd make an excuse about how she couldn't\n"
"reach the mansion cuz of the fallen bridge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0015 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Problem is, because of her murder plans,\n"
"we don't even know where she was killed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0016 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "She was killed on the <CLT=cltSTRONG>roof<CLT=cltNORMAL>, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Kokichi told us the roof door was locked,\n"
"and that he couldn't get through."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "Maybe...that when culprit kill her?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0019 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"That's probably what happened.\n"
"The culprit killed her on the locked roof."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0020 | C001_Momot"
msgid "Did the culprit lock the door to the roof?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0021 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Perhaps. I don't think Miu did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"If Miu did lock it, she would have done it\n"
"when she called Kokichi to the roof."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0023 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Even if someone came up, I don't believe\n"
"she would change the target of her plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0024 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"She knew that Kokichi would come up later.\n"
"Locking the door would be suspicious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0025 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Well, it's possible she didn't \n"
"even think that far ahead..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"She was smart... \n"
"But she was also really, really dumb."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0027 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "N-No say such mean things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0028 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "Killing game bad, not Miu."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0029 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Miu not bad person. Gonta think we\n"
"coulda been friends, if things different."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0030 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"That...might've been difficult.\n"
"Even without this killing game."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0031 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "That wouldn't happen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0032 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "Nuh-uh. No way, Jose."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0033 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0034 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Anyway...let's continue the discussion.\n"
"If Miu was killed on the roof of the mansion..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0035 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"The culprit must have moved Miu's avatar\n"
"to the chapel after killing her, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"So the next thing we should talk about\n"
"is how they moved her avatar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Now we know that the mansion and \n"
"chapel were actually next to each other."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "But the problem is the wall between them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Only Miu was able to go through that wall.\n"
"The culprit wouldn't have been able to..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"Then you're saying the culprit sent\n"
"Miu's avatar through that wall?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Yeah, that's the only way, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"But how did the culprit send Miu's\n"
"avatar through the wall?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C001_Momot"
msgid "I mean, it's not like they coulda thrown her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "Gonta not throw her!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"We know. You couldn't because the avatars'\n"
"<CLT=cltSTRONG>physical strength was equalized<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "Physical strength...equalized?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"That problem! Gonta no can protect\n"
"everyone if that happens!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Geez, keep up with us. We're already \n"
"in the second half of the class trial."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Hmmm... How did they send Miu's avatar\n"
"to the other side of the wall?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Maybe that thing has something to do with it?\n"
"Y'know...the <CLT=cltSTRONG>loud sound<CLT=cltNORMAL> you heard?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | chara_Blank"
msgid "<CLT=cltSYSTEM>BANG!!!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Ah!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Wh-What!? What was that sound!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"Because of that sound, you guys went to\n"
"the side of the chapel. Right, Kee-boy?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"That's when you found the dead Miu there,\n"
"riiiiight?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"If so, then I think that sound and her avatar\n"
"being by the chapel are related..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>Yes, there's no doubt in my mind\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>It might be the clue we need\n"
"to solve this case."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>So what was it? It sounded like something\n"
"slamming hard into something else..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>So what were those two things?\n"
"It could be..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "The hammer hitting the wall"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"The sound we heard was the hammer\n"
"hitting against the wall."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Would a hammer make that much noise?\n"
"It sounded like something bigger..."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Do you think a lattice would make such\n"
"a loud noise?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
