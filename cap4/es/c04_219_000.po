msgctxt "0004 | C010_Haruk"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0017 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Then her secret route was\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0018 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"That's it, right? Like using a glitch\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0022 | C014_Iruma"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C007_Ki-Bo"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C000_Saiha"

msgctxt "0067 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""

msgctxt "0071 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"First off, sound can't go past \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "Did that sound really come from the chapel?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"That sound was something hitting the \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "What—? That is pretty strange..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Exactly. That has to be some kind of clue\n"
