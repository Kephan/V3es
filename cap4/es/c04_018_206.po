msgstr ""

msgctxt "0026 | C005_Oma__"

msgctxt "0030 | C014_Iruma"

msgctxt "0031 | C012_Shiro"

msgctxt "0035 | C014_Iruma"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0036 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "Ouch!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0037 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"It means that this goes way beyond the realm of\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0038 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "We get it, so stop hitting me!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0039 | C005_Oma__"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0040 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "E-Even here...I can't escape your robophobia!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0041 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...How are our senses set up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0042 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"When your avatar receives any sensory input,\n"
"electrical signals are sent to your brain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0043 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Your brain then interprets those signals as if\n"
"it experienced that sensory input for real."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0044 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"So even if we're not really being punched,\n"
"the brain senses pain cuz of those signals..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0045 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"And since it won't leave any bruises,\n"
"you can hit all you want!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0046 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "That's a bully's twisted logic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0047 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Hey! Why our bodies like this!?\n"
"This Himiko's magic!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0048 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Well...there's a lot of things going on right\n"
"now, but you don't have to worry, Gonta."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0049 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"So...how exactly are we supposed to find\n"
"the <CLT=cltSTRONG>secret of the outside world<CLT=cltNORMAL>?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0050 | C001_Momot"
msgid "We don't even know where to start looking."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0051 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"First, we need to learn more about this\n"
"world. Is there a map available?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0052 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I've got a map, but first I gotta give\n"
"you a quick warning about this world."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0053 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"Huh? A warning? You need to be quicker \n"
"on the draw with stuff like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0054 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"I-I'm plenty quick on the draw! But not too\n"
"quick, cuz then you can't pull out in time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0055 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "Shut up..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0056 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>I wonder what the rules\n"
"for this place could be..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0057 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"Information from our five senses here\n"
"is sent to our real bodies..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0058 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"But it seems like information from our real\n"
"bodies isn't sent to our consciousness here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0059 | C001_Momot"
msgid "If that's the case, then...it's fine, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0060 | C001_Momot"
msgid ""
"We gotta make sure we know how this world \n"
"works. Let's go after Miu and check the map."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0061 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "So this is \"<CLT=cltSTRONG>Ver-chewal World<CLT=cltNORMAL>\"..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0062 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid "But how we even get here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0063 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Gonta not feel anyone pick him up.\n"
"And we got here so fast..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0064 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"Ah, well, it's like Tsumugi said,\n"
"you don't have to worry..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0065 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"N-No! If Gonta not strong, Gonta no can\n"
"protect everyone!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0066 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"Hey, who Gonta gotta talk to get strong\n"
"again!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0067 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "I honestly thought it'd be more like an MMO..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0068 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"But if our senses are connected, then that\n"
"means it's just another reality."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0069 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"You guys better not cheat by logging out alone!\n"
"We have to find the <CLT=cltSTRONG>secret of the outside world<CLT=cltNORMAL>!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0070 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"I never thought it'd be possible to link\n"
"our real-world senses with our avatars..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0071 | C005_Oma__"
msgid ""
"And I never thought a robot had a <CLT=cltSTRONG>consciousness<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"to begin with..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0072 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid "...And I thought you would say that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0073 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"We're receiving too much information after\n"
"the fact... I feel somewhat deceived..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0074 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"But if the <CLT=cltSTRONG>secret of the outside world<CLT=cltNORMAL> is\n"
"really here, we can't turn back now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0075 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"On top of the graphics and our senses, \n"
"now there are even more warnings...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0076 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "This really *is* fraud!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0077 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Oh yeah! I forgot to say something \n"
"really important!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0078 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, it seems like I can't \n"
"use my magic here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0079 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "So don't rely on me like usual, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0080 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...I don't recall ever relying\n"
"on you in the past."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0081 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, it seems like I can't \n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0082 | C009_Yumen"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0083 | chara_Blank"
msgid ""
"<CLT=cltMIND>...I don't recall ever relying\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "0084 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...Hurry up with this conversation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0085 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"I want to find the <CLT=cltSTRONG>secret of the outside world<CLT=cltNORMAL>\n"
"and head back to the real world already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0086 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "I'm not as strong in this world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0087 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"I'm guessing...because it's programmed like\n"
"that for the <CLT=cltSTRONG>killing game simulator<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0088 | C010_Haruk"
msgid ""
"They want to see what kind of killing game\n"
"it'll be when no one has their special talent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0089 | C010_Haruk"
msgid "...That's probably the reason."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0090 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"The graphics here... There are old-school \n"
"games with better graphics than this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0091 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"If they were gonna go retro, they should've\n"
"gone all the way and had it be all blocky..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0092 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "Objects won't break..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0093 | C012_Shiro"
msgid ""
"That may seem convenient at first, but I feel\n"
"like it's going to end up being a problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0094 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "So, what do you have to tell us, Miu?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0095 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Well, it's not that big of a deal, but there is\n"
"a special rule to this world..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0096 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "...Objects here are unbreakable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0097 | C000_Saiha"
msgid "Hm? Objects don't break?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0098 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"In the Virtual World, there are no rules that\n"
"govern whether <CLT=cltSTRONG>objects can break<CLT=cltNORMAL>."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0099 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"So any object, no matter what it is, can\n"
"never be broken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0100 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"For example, if you stretch a rubber band\n"
"far enough, it'll eventually tear, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0101 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"But here, the rubber band would stop stretching\n"
"at a certain point, and just not tear at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0102 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"For the same reason, your avatars can't get\n"
"injured. You'll still feel pain, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0103 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "See? I told ya it's not a big deal!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0104 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"What are you talking about!? That's a really big\n"
"deal! You gotta tell us stuff like that before!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0105 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Heeeeeeeeeeeee! S-Sorry!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0106 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"B-But...that's the only special thing! In every\n"
"other sense, the physics here are the same—"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0107 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"...Oh, wait. That's right... There's a special\n"
"thing about the avatars, too..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0108 | C009_Yumen"
msgid "There's still more!? Spit it out already!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0109 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Heeeeeeeeee! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0110 | C012_Shiro"
msgid "And what's special about the avatars?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0111 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"To make things fair...everyone's avatar in this\n"
"world has the same averaged physical strength..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0112 | C007_Ki-Bo"
msgid ""
"Does that mean there is no discernable\n"
"difference in our physical abilities?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0113 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"So in this Virtual World, I'm just \n"
"as strong as Gonta?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0114 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"What!? Gonta weaker!?\n"
"That also cuz of Himiko's magic!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0115 | C004_Gokuh"
msgid ""
"N-No! If Gonta not strong, Gonta no can\n"
"protect everyone!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0116 | C009_Yumen"
msgid ""
"I-It's not my fault. That's...just how \n"
"this world is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0117 | C000_Saiha"
msgid ""
"...Are those the only things\n"
"different about this world, Miu?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0118 | C014_Iruma"
msgid "Y-Yeah...that's everything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0119 | C005_Oma__"
msgid "By the way, how do we log out from this world?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0120 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"O-Oh yeah, that's right...\n"
"I need to tell you that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0121 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"If you ever wanna log out, you just need\n"
"to use that phone over there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0122 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Just pick it up and say your name.\n"
"That simple enough for you shitheads?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0123 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Also, that phone is fixed and can't be\n"
"removed from that room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0124 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Which means, you have to use this room\n"
"to log in and log out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0125 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
"Whenever you log in, you'll always appear\n"
"in this room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0126 | C005_Oma__"

msgctxt "0128 | C001_Momot"
msgid "Yeah, we got it. So where's this map?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "0129 | C014_Iruma"
msgid ""
